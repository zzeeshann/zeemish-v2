## 2026-04-24: Area 4 sub-task 4.3 — `<quiz-card>` Web Component

**Context:** Sub-task 4.2 set up the route to emit `<quiz-card data-interactive-id="…">` with a JSON payload child script + `<noscript>` Q&A fallback. 4.3 defines the custom element that upgrades the inert markup into an interactive quiz with a results screen.

**Decisions:**

1. **Progressive-enhancement contract: `<noscript>` fallback is the baseline, JS upgrade adds interactivity.** When JS is off (or the script fails to load), the element stays inert and the browser surfaces the `<noscript>` content — a readable `<ol>` with questions, options, and "Answer: …" explanations. When JS runs, `connectedCallback` appends a new `.quiz` container as a sibling of the `<script>` + `<noscript>` children; the browser naturally hides `<noscript>` content when JS is on, so no imperative hide. The server-rendered payload is the single source of truth that both states read.

2. **Custom element registration over Shadow DOM.** Matches the existing pattern (`<lesson-shell>`, `<audio-player>`, `<zita-chat>`, `<made-drawer>` all use light DOM + `customElements.define`). Shadow DOM would isolate styles but the site has no style leakage problem and the existing `quiz.css` selectors are scoped enough (`.quiz`, `.quiz-option`, `.quiz-review-item`). Light DOM also keeps the `<script>` JSON payload query trivially addressable.

3. **Direct import, not `register.ts`.** `register.ts` bundles the five components daily-piece pages need. Interactive pages don't need any of them — so `src/pages/interactives/[slug].astro` imports `quiz-card` directly via `<script>`. Keeps the interactive-page bundle minimal.

4. **JSON payload via `<script type="application/json">` child, not a `data-*` attribute.** Attributes work for small payloads but stringifying 3–5 questions × 4 options × ~200-char explanations overflows the attribute ergonomics (escaping, line breaks, readability on View Source). `<script type="application/json">` is the standard pattern for server-to-client JSON handoff — browsers don't execute it, the payload preserves formatting, and it reads cleanly in DevTools.

5. **Per-question local state; no server round-trips between questions.** User clicks an option → `selections[currentIndex] = optionIndex` → re-render the current question with the new selected state. Next button advances `currentIndex` + re-renders. The only network calls are the `started` POST on mount and the `completed` POST on results render. Zero latency between question interactions. A wrong answer doesn't penalise the user mid-quiz — correctness is revealed only on the results screen, so the flow feels low-stakes.

6. **Results screen is the only reveal of correctness.** Per-question borders colour-code (green left-border for correct, red-ish for wrong); each item shows the user's answer and — only when wrong — the correct answer plus the explanation. Correct answers get the explanation too (reinforces the reasoning, not just the mark). No "try again" button — if the user wants to retry, they reload. Spec called out "no auto-routing — reader chooses"; the "Back to library" link in the outer route layout is the only exit affordance.

7. **Mount POST fires once per mount (idempotent-adjacent).** Guarded by a `startedFired` boolean so a dev-HMR remount doesn't double-POST in the same connectedCallback pass. Not strictly idempotent across navigations (a user who leaves and comes back generates two `interactive_started` rows) — the 4.7 endpoint aggregates at query time, so this is fine.

8. **Completion POST fires on results render with `score` + `per_question_correctness` array.** Shape matches the 4.1 schema for `interactive_engagement`: `{interactive_id, event_type, score, per_question_correctness: [1,0,1,1]}`. Correctness is an array of 0/1 ints in question order — not option indices, not "correct"/"wrong" strings — so aggregation queries can SUM across runs to see which questions are hardest without re-parsing each row. `keepalive: true` on the fetch so it survives a page-unload race if the user navigates away immediately after results render.

9. **404 is the happy path for 4.3 only.** The endpoint lands in 4.7. Until then, the POSTs return 404 Not Found, which the component swallows via `.catch(() => {})`. The UI doesn't need to know whether tracking succeeded — the reader's experience is identical. Once 4.7 builds the endpoint, the calls start landing without a client change. No feature flag, no conditional — the simplest thing that works both before and after 4.7.

10. **Accessibility: radiogroup pattern on the option list.** Options are `<button>` elements (keyboard + screen-reader friendly by default) inside a container with `role="radiogroup"` and `aria-label` = question text. Each option is `role="radio"` + `aria-checked="true"|"false"` to match native radio semantics even though the elements are buttons — `<input type="radio">` would pass semantically but would fight the styling. Focus-visible outlines inherit the primary green. 44px min tap targets on buttons and options.

11. **Styling mirrors the existing palette.** `#1A6B62` primary, `#E8E4DE` border, `#F5F2ED` summary surface, `#B54747` for the wrong-answer accent (same family as existing error reds elsewhere). No new colour tokens. Rounded corners match `.beat-nav-btn`. Typography scale follows existing `.beats.css` h2 / p rules.

**Trade-offs:**
- Re-rendering the whole container on every state change is wasteful for a 4-question quiz but below any perceptible latency. At 12+ questions it would want a more granular update — not now.
- No retry button means a user who wants to try again must reload. Simpler code, slightly worse UX. Revisit if readers complain.
- `keepalive: true` on fetch has a 64KB payload limit — fine here (our payloads are ~200 bytes).
- `startedFired` is a per-element boolean, not per-session. A reader who reloads mid-quiz generates two `started` rows. Acceptable — aggregation via DISTINCT user_id handles it.
- Under JS-enabled but with the Web Component script failing to load (404 on quiz-card.ts chunk), the user sees the eyebrow + title + concept + back link and NOTHING else — `<noscript>` doesn't surface because JS is on. Mitigation would be a small "Interactive unavailable — refresh to try again" message that's hidden when the element upgrades. Not adding in v1 — script-load failures are rare on Astro-bundled assets, and the page still has a visible way forward via the back link.

**Verified in preview (localhost:4321):**
- Custom element registers: `customElements.get('quiz-card')` defined; container renders with `.quiz-counter`, `.quiz-question`, 4 `.quiz-option` buttons.
- Selection works: clicking option 2 sets `data-selected`, enables `.quiz-next` (was disabled with no selection).
- Navigation works: Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 → Results, counter increments correctly, "Next question" becomes "See results" on the last question.
- Results render: "3 of 4 correct" with the deliberate 3/4 pattern; per-question review cards show ✓ on correct rows, ✗ on the wrong row, "Correct answer" label only on the wrong row, explanations on all rows.
- POST shapes captured via fetch spy: `interactive_started` POSTs on mount with `{interactive_id, event_type}`; `interactive_completed` POSTs on results with `{interactive_id, event_type, score: 3, per_question_correctness: [1,0,1,1]}`. Both return 404 — expected, swallowed silently. Payload shape matches the 4.1 schema exactly.
- Screenshot verified: question state + results state render cleanly, colour coding on review cards (green/red left-border), primary green button, 44px tap targets.
- `pnpm build` passes.

**Rollback:** `git revert <commit>`. Removing `src/interactive/quiz-card.ts` + `src/styles/quiz.css` + the import line in the route file is a clean undo — the rest of the interactive page (title / concept / `<noscript>` fallback) keeps working.

## 2026-04-24: Area 4 sub-task 4.2 — content collection + route

**Context:** Area 4 interactives are 1:1 with pieces but meant to work standalone. Sub-task 4.1 set up the DB surface; 4.2 picks where the actual content lives and renders it at a URL. The choice: git-versioned content collection (Option A) vs D1 `interactives.content_json` (Option B). Both paths are viable. The question is which better fits "useful standalone, independent, fixable on their own" and the established publishing architecture.

**Decisions:**

1. **Content collection wins. Files live at `content/interactives/<slug>.json`.** The user's explicit intent "fixable on their own" is the deciding factor — git-versioned content means a broken quiz fixes via a PR (edit JSON, push, CI rebuilds, deploys). With D1 as source of truth, a broken quiz fixes via a `wrangler d1 execute` UPDATE or a not-yet-built admin UI; both are worse operator ergonomics. Additionally: the daily-pieces flow already works this way (Publisher commits MDX → CI rebuilds → Cloudflare deploys), so the Generator (sub-task 4.4) reuses an existing mechanic rather than introducing a new one. The admin surface gets transparency for free — every interactive is a reviewable file in the repo, not a hidden row.

2. **JSON over MDX.** Interactives are structured data (questions, options, correctIndex, explanation) — there's no teaching-prose body. MDX is the right format when the body IS the teaching; JSON is right when the structure IS the teaching. Later types (breathing params, chart data, game state) are also naturally JSON. Astro's `glob` loader handles `.json` natively via content collections.

3. **`interactives.content_json` in D1 becomes a nullable convenience mirror, NOT source of truth.** v1 writers leave it NULL. Readers always go to `getCollection('interactives')`. The column stays for two reasons: (a) the 4.1 decision is still right — future admin filters may want to query content shape without filesystem joins; (b) removing it would require a `daily_pieces` / `interactives` table rebuild now that the column exists. Cost of leaving it null is zero bytes of storage per row. SCHEMA.md updated to reflect this clarification.

4. **Schema uses a Zod `discriminatedUnion` on `type`.** First (and only) branch is `quiz` with constraints: 3–5 questions, 2–6 options per question, integer `correctIndex`, required `explanation` per question. Adding a new type (`breathing`, `chart`, `game`) is a two-step change: widen the `type` enum + add a branch to the union. No migration, no backfill. Build-time Zod validation means a malformed file fails CI, not production.

5. **Prerender the route (`getStaticPaths`), don't SSR.** Interactives are self-contained files — no D1 needed to render. Matches daily pieces' prerender pattern; gives fast static HTML. SSR would be needed only if the page pulled anything from D1, which it doesn't (engagement tracking in 4.7 is a POST side-channel, not a render-time read). Library is SSR because it needs D1 category queries; interactives don't have that dependency.

6. **`<quiz-card>` placeholder in 4.2, Web Component definition in 4.3.** Route emits `<quiz-card data-interactive-id="…">` with the full question set as a `<script type="application/json" data-quiz-content>` payload + a `<noscript>` fallback rendering the full Q&A list as a plain `<ol>`. Under JS-enabled with no custom element registered (the state during 4.2), the user sees the eyebrow + title + concept + back link but nothing where the quiz will be. Acceptable — 4.3 upgrades the element within a day. Under no-JS, the `<noscript>` list surfaces — verified via HTML fetch that the `<ol>` contains all questions, options, and "Answer: …" explanations.

7. **404 behaviour via `getStaticPaths`.** Unknown slugs hit Astro's default 404 page (the project's custom `src/pages/404.astro`) — no explicit handling needed. Verified: `/interactives/nonexistent-slug/` returns HTTP 404.

8. **Filename convention: `<slug>.json` (no date prefix).** Daily pieces use `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.mdx` because they're discovered and organised by date. Interactives are discovered and organised by slug — the URL is the slug. Adding a date prefix would force the URL/filename to diverge or embed a date nobody cares about. One slug = one file.

9. **Test fixture is abstract, zero references to published pieces.** [content/interactives/chokepoints-and-cascades.json](../content/interactives/chokepoints-and-cascades.json) teaches the concept of chokepoints + cascading failures in fully generic terms — no mention of Hormuz, QVC, airlines, Iran, or any specific piece. This is both a functional test fixture and a concrete anchor for the "essence not reference" quality bar the Generator prompt (4.4) must enforce. If you read it and can't tell which piece it came from, the bar is met.

**Trade-offs:**
- Every new interactive triggers a full site rebuild (already the case for daily pieces — not new cost).
- Generator's write path is more complex than a D1 INSERT (needs a GitHub Contents API call, same as Publisher's daily flow). Acceptable — the Publisher's existing infrastructure handles it with minimal new code in 4.4.
- A 2026-04-24 build that prerenders everything at once will bundle all interactives into every deploy — fine until we have thousands of them, at which point we can revisit lazy/SSR.
- Schema validation at build time means a malformed Generator output fails CI with a Zod error, not at render time — good (early failure) but means CI becomes the gate; a bad file blocks unrelated deploys. Mitigated because the Generator audits itself (4.5) before committing, so malformed files shouldn't reach git.

**Verified:** preview server at :4321.
- Route `/interactives/chokepoints-and-cascades/` returns 200, HTML is 78KB.
- Page title "Chokepoints and Cascades", eyebrow "INTERACTIVE · QUIZ", concept rendered, back link to library.
- `<quiz-card>` element present with `data-interactive-id` attribute matching the UUID in the fixture.
- `<script type="application/json" data-quiz-content>` carries the full question set — parsed in-page, confirmed 4 questions, `type: quiz`, first question text matches fixture.
- `<noscript>` fallback contains `<ol>` with all questions and "Answer: …" explanations (verified via fetched HTML inspection).
- Unknown slug `/interactives/nonexistent-slug/` returns HTTP 404.
- Zero console errors.

**Rollback:** `git revert <commit>`. No migration in this commit (4.1 already shipped the tables). Deleting the content collection entry from `content.config.ts` + the `content/interactives/` dir + the `src/pages/interactives/` dir is a clean removal.

## 2026-04-24: Area 4 sub-task 4.1 — `interactives` + `interactive_engagement` schema

**Context:** Area 4 introduces interactives as a first-class system — standalone-addressable teaching artefacts (first type `quiz`, later `breathing` / `game` / `chart`), 1:1 with pieces but useful without reading the source piece ("essence not reference"). Two new agents (InteractiveGenerator + InteractiveAuditor) need a data surface. Sub-task 4.1 is schema only, no writer, no reader — plumbing that unblocks 4.2 onward.

**Decisions:**

1. **`daily_pieces.interactive_id TEXT` is the single source of truth for "piece has an interactive".** Not the pre-existing `daily_pieces.has_interactive INTEGER` column. `has_interactive` was scaffolded in migration 0006 but no writer, no reader, and no SELECT ever referenced it — every prod row is 0. Grep confirmed one TypeScript type declaration at [src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro](src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro) as the single hit, with no conditional rendering on it. Keeping both columns and syncing at write time would re-introduce the drift pattern we avoided with `categories.piece_count` in Area 2 (where we accepted denormalisation only because the library's chip-sort read path justified it). Here there's no read pressure. Single column, single truth.

2. **`has_interactive` stays physical, deprecated.** SQLite `DROP COLUMN` requires a full `daily_pieces` table rebuild (snapshot → create-new → copy → drop-old → rename, the same dance as migration 0015 for `daily_piece_audio`). `daily_pieces` is the central piece table with 6+ other tables FK-referencing it — the blast radius of a rebuild for pure hygiene is too wide. Column stays, writers don't touch it, SCHEMA.md marks it deprecated with a forwarding note, the lone type declaration is removed in the same commit so there's zero consumers. The column sits inert (always 0) with zero runtime cost.

3. **`interactive_engagement` is an append-only event log, not aggregated per day.** The existing `engagement` table aggregates views / completions / avg_time_seconds per (piece_id, course_id, date). For interactives, the natural shape is events — `offered` / `started` / `completed` / `skipped` — and completed events carry per-question correctness as a JSON array that doesn't aggregate cleanly (we care about individual-response distributions, not a sum). Events are cheap; aggregation at query time via GROUP BY / DISTINCT is the right layer. Mirrors how `observer_events` and `audit_results` work.

4. **`content_json TEXT` on the row regardless of sub-task 4.2's content-home decision.** 4.2 will decide whether the authoritative content home is a git-versioned `content/interactives/` collection or D1's `content_json`. Either way the row exists for metadata (id, slug, type, title, quality_flag, voice_score, etc.) — and the column gives D1 a queryable copy for admin views, debugging, and any reader that prefers one source. If 4.2 picks content-collection, `content_json` is a convenience mirror the Generator writes on commit; if D1, it's the source. Shape is the same from the DB's perspective.

5. **`type` as loose TEXT, no CHECK.** Consistent with `learnings.source`, `learnings.category`, `observer_events.severity`. First value is `'quiz'`; adding `'breathing'` / `'game'` / `'chart'` later is a zero-migration change. Application layer validates.

6. **`revision_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` on the row; no `interactive_audit_results` table yet.** Daily pieces persist per-round audit notes in `audit_results` so operators can see revision history on the admin page. For interactives, v1 only needs "did the Generator+Auditor loop pass on round 1 / 2 / 3?" — `revision_count` on the row captures that. Per-round notes become valuable when a debugging session needs to understand *why* an interactive was revised, or when 4.5 surfaces the auditor's flags on the (not-yet-built) admin interactive-detail page. FOLLOWUPS entry logged to revisit.

7. **No FK REFERENCES anywhere.** Consistent with every other join column in this codebase's 21 prior migrations. Application layer owns integrity.

8. **Quality-flag semantic mirrors `daily_pieces.quality_flag` exactly.** NULL = passed, `'low'` = auditor max-failed (3 revision rounds) but shipped anyway. Readers can still reach the interactive at its URL (`/interactives/<slug>/`), but the last-beat prompt on the source piece (sub-task 4.6) filters it out. Same ship-and-retry posture as the text pipeline's voice-fail-but-publish path.

9. **Indexes chosen for Generator/Auditor writes + admin/reader reads.** `idx_interactives_slug` (lookup by URL slug — explicit alongside UNIQUE auto-index for clarity), `idx_interactives_source_piece` (reverse lookup "does this piece have an interactive"), `idx_interactives_published_at DESC` (admin list newest-first). On engagement: `idx_int_engagement_user` (reader's own history), `idx_int_engagement_interactive` (per-interactive completion stats), `idx_int_engagement_int_type` (event-type filter — "how many skipped vs completed").

**Trade-offs:**
- `has_interactive` sits in the schema as dead weight. A year from now, someone might see "why is this always 0?" and grep. Mitigation: SCHEMA.md marks it deprecated with a forwarding note; this DECISIONS entry explains why it wasn't dropped.
- If we find `content_json` on the row is wasteful storage (large JSON × many interactives), we can null it out and fall back to content-collection reads. Reversible.
- `revision_count` alone doesn't tell us *why* something was revised. Fine for v1 — the debugging case isn't urgent until we have interactives in production being revised.
- Event-log table grows without bound. At scale (hundreds of interactives × thousands of readers), a periodic aggregation job into a summary table may be needed. Defer until we see the volume.

**Rollback:** `DROP TABLE interactive_engagement; DROP TABLE interactives;` — both empty at migration time. `daily_pieces.interactive_id` stays physical (can't drop in SQLite without a rebuild); it sits nullable and inert if the code is rolled back. Same reasoning as why we don't rebuild to drop `has_interactive`.

**Verified:** Migration 0022 applied cleanly to remote D1. PRAGMA confirmed:
- `interactives` — 12 columns, types + nullability match spec, `revision_count` DEFAULT 0 correct.
- `interactive_engagement` — 7 columns, correct NOT NULLs on user_id / interactive_id / event_type / created_at.
- Indexes all present (3 on interactives + 1 UNIQUE auto-index; 3 on interactive_engagement).
- `daily_pieces.interactive_id` appears at the end of the column list, nullable TEXT, `idx_daily_pieces_interactive` present.
- Both new tables empty (COUNT = 0 each).

Sets up 4.2 (content home + route) with everything it needs to either write a DB row or a content-collection file.

## 2026-04-24: Area 3 sub-task 3.4 — Admin "All pieces" month-grouped + collapsible

**Context:** Admin home's All Pieces list is a flat scroll. At 9 pieces today it's fine; at 50 it's long; at 365 it's unusable. Library already month-groups (flat, no collapse) — admin should too, but collapsed by default to keep the rest of the control-room scannable.

**Decisions:**

1. **Month-grouped `<details>`, current month open by default.** Each month becomes a `<details>` with `<summary>` = `{Month Year} · N pieces · ▸`. Pieces sort newest-first, so the first group is always the current (or most recent) month — that one gets `open`. Older months collapsed. Triangle indicator mirrors the 3.1 pattern in the same codebase (`▸` with `group-open:rotate-90`).

2. **Filter auto-expands groups with matches; doesn't force-close.** When the filter input has text, any month containing a matching piece opens automatically. Groups with zero matches hide entirely (not just collapse — same as library's `group.style.display = visible ? '' : 'none'` pattern). When the filter clears, user-expanded groups stay expanded — we don't reset to "first open, rest closed". Fighting the user's explicit expand is annoying, and the default-on-load state is already correct for a fresh visit.

3. **Not extracting a shared component with library.** Library and admin diverge on three axes: tag (`<section>` vs `<details>`), item content (library shows full piece cards with description + subject pill; admin shows compact stat rows with date · tier · voice · rounds · candidates · flagged), and collapse behaviour (library is always flat; admin collapses). A shared component would need slots + render props for near-zero reuse — the only truly-shared bit is the `MONTH_NAMES` array (4 lines). Keep parallel implementations. If a third consumer emerges, extract then.

4. **Month-label computation stays inline in admin.astro.** Already inline in `src/pages/library/index.astro`. Duplicating the 12-element month-names array is cheaper than the import + test + maintenance cost of a `src/lib/format-month.ts`. The format is culturally stable (months don't rename); if we ever localise, both call sites switch together in one grep.

5. **Tailwind `group-hover` rename: `group/row` in scoped rows.** Each piece row previously used `group-hover:text-zee-primary`. With the `<details class="group">` wrapper around the month container, Tailwind's default `group` selector would match the nearest ancestor — now the details, not the row. Renamed the row-level modifier to `group/row` (Tailwind's named-group syntax) so hover colour still applies to the anchor being hovered, not every anchor in an open month. Verified visually: opening a month doesn't light up every headline.

**Trade-offs:**
- A user who opens every month then types a filter won't see their old expand state restored when they clear the filter. Accepted — the alternative (remembering pre-filter open state) needs state tracking and isn't intuitive. Typing a filter is already explicit; clearing it restoring nothing is fine.
- Month groups don't show per-month stats in the summary (e.g., how many rough / how many flagged). Could be added; not in 3.4 scope. The per-row tier pill still surfaces that inside an open group.
- `data-month-count` attribute added on the count span but not yet consumed. Reserved for a future tweak (e.g., "N pieces · K flagged" in summary) — minor forward surface. Cheap to leave; trivially deletable if unused in 6 months.

**Files:** EDIT [`src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro) — frontmatter month-group computation block (19 lines), template swap from flat `<ul>` to grouped `<details>` blocks, filter JS extended to hide/open month groups. EDIT [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (sub-task 3.4 entry under Area 3).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm build` clean.
- Seeded 4 extra pieces across April / March / February locally. Curl'd admin page: 3 month-groups rendered — `April 2026 (5 pieces, open)`, `March 2026 (1 piece, closed)`, `February 2026 (1 piece, closed)`. Count strings singular/plural-aware.
- Filter logic simulated against the 7 seeded pieces: `"qvc"` → 1 piece in April, April auto-opens, others hide; `"march"` → 1 in March, March auto-opens; `"2026-02"` → 1 in Feb, Feb auto-opens; `"nothingmatches"` → zero visible, all groups hidden, empty-state shows; empty filter (clear) → everything visible, user-expand state preserved.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-24: Area 3 sub-task 3.3 — Admin observer feed severity chips

**Context:** Admin home shows 100 latest observer events chronologically. When something breaks at 2am UTC, the operator wants "what broke" first — scrolling past info-level metering and skipped-run chatter to find the one warn or escalation is the wrong shape. Add a filter at the top.

**Decisions:**

1. **Three chips: All · Warn · Escalation.** Confirmed severity set by grepping `agents/src/observer.ts` — only three values are ever written (`info | warn | escalation`; type declaration at line 6 is the source of truth). Info isn't its own chip because (a) the spec said All·Warn·Escalation explicitly, (b) info is operational noise the operator rarely wants to isolate — when isolating, you're looking for signals, not baselines. Info stays visible under "All". Counts render inline on each chip (`All 100 · Warn 4 · Escalation 2`) so the operator sees volume before clicking.

2. **Client-side filter, no query param.** Admin is a real-time polling surface (pipeline status refreshes; the feed implicitly revalidates on reload). Persisting filter state in the URL would add friction without benefit — a triage session's filter choice is ephemerally session-local. Button-based chips with `aria-pressed` toggles, vanilla JS click handler mutates `card.style.display` + chip class state. Same pattern as the existing All-Pieces text filter on the same page, and visually matches the Area 2 library CategoryChips bar (rounded-full pills, `min-h-[44px]` mobile tap target, flex-wrap, primary background on active).

3. **Chip counts computed in-memory from the already-loaded slice.** No extra D1 query. Astro frontmatter already loads 100 rows; `observerWarnCount` + `observerEscalationCount` are `.filter(...).length` on that slice. Implication: counts reflect the 100-row window, not lifetime severity totals. At current volume that window spans weeks; when it saturates, "100 events · 4 warn · 2 escalation" is still the right framing for recent-triage intent. Lifetime counts would lie about urgency (a 6-month-old escalation isn't the operator's current problem).

4. **Empty-state copy when a filter zeros out.** "No events match this filter." appears when an active chip returns zero cards (e.g., clicking Warn on a week with no warns). Covers the edge case where chip counts update faster than the cards do — but in the current implementation counts are rendered from the same slice the cards come from, so this state should be rare. Defensive copy rather than dead code because future chip additions (e.g., filter by acknowledged state) might hit the path more often.

5. **Inline in `admin.astro`, not a shared component.** The Area 2 library chip bar became a shared `<CategoryChips>` component because both `/library/` and `/library/<slug>/` use it. Severity chips are specific to one feed on one page — extracting to a component would add indirection without reuse. If a second feed ever needs severity filtering (per-piece admin observer section, maybe), revisit then.

**Trade-offs:**
- Chip counts don't update when events are acknowledged mid-session. The counts are rendered at page load time and reflect all loaded events regardless of ack state. Accepted: ack status is orthogonal to severity; operator triaging by severity doesn't care whether something was already acknowledged. If this feels wrong later, a "hide acknowledged" toggle is the natural follow-on, not severity-chip recounting.
- Chip counts don't reflect events beyond the 100-row window. See decision (3) — this is intentional.
- No "Info" chip. If operators later want to isolate info-level noise (diagnostic deep-dive), adding a fourth chip is 4 lines of markup + updating the count tally. Not worth building preemptively.

**Files:** EDIT [`src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro) — 2 new count-derivation lines, chip bar markup block, ~20 lines of filter-handler JS appended to the existing `<script>`. EDIT [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (sub-task 3.3 entry under Area 3).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm build` clean.
- Seeded 6 local observer events (3 info, 2 warn, 1 escalation). Curl'd admin page: 3 chips render with `All 6 · Warn 2 · Escalation 1`; every card carries `data-severity`; empty-state `<p>` present (hidden until zero-match). "All" chip initial state has `aria-pressed="true"` and primary background; others are idle.
- Filter logic mirrored in a standalone simulation: click Warn → 2 cards visible; click Escalation → 1 card visible; click All → 6; zero-match case triggers empty state correctly.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-24: Area 3 sub-task 3.2 — Piece page observer events strictly scoped by piece_id

**Context:** The admin piece-detail page's observer section was pooling both same-day pieces' events at 12h cadence, plus system events (admin_settings_changed, zita_rate_limited) that aren't about any piece. Migration 0020 added `observer_events.piece_id` on 2026-04-22, but the query on the piece page still OR'd with a 36h day-window fallback for legacy null-piece_id rows — and four site-worker Zita writers never had their piece_id threading completed (the "bigger cross-cutting refactor deferred" in CLAUDE.md from 2026-04-22). This sub-task closes that gap and drops the fallback.

**Decisions:**

1. **Drop the 36h day-window fallback on the piece page.** The query is now strict: `SELECT * FROM observer_events WHERE piece_id = ? ORDER BY created_at ASC`. Legacy null-piece_id rows (pre-migration-0020 historical + rate-limit events by design) become invisible on per-piece pages. They stay visible on the global admin feed — that surface keeps a time-window query because it's the right level for cross-piece operational triage. No data is lost; the visibility classification is corrected.

2. **Thread piece-id client → API for Zita.** The path: [content frontmatter `pieceId`] → [`daily/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/daily/[date]/[slug].astro) passes `pieceId` prop → [`LessonLayout.astro`](../src/layouts/LessonLayout.astro) emits `piece-id` attribute on `<zita-chat>` → [`zita-chat.ts`](../src/interactive/zita-chat.ts) reads attribute and includes `piece_id` in POST body → [`/api/zita/chat`](../src/pages/api/zita/chat.ts) validates UUID shape and threads into `logObserverEvent` `pieceId` parameter for three writes (truncated / claude_failed / handler_threw).

3. **Rate-limit observer event stays null-piece_id.** The rate-limit check at [chat.ts:60](../src/pages/api/zita/chat.ts:60) fires BEFORE `request.json()` so we don't yet have `piece_date` or `piece_id` when logging the event. Moving rate-limiting post-parse would let attackers trigger JSON-parse work at unlimited RPS. Rate-limit events stay system-level (null piece_id) — admin sees them on the global feed alongside `admin_settings_changed`, never on a piece page. Correct classification, not a gap.

4. **UUID validation on `piece_id` input.** Server-side regex `/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i`. Malformed input is treated as absent (falls back to null piece_id) rather than rejected with 400. Reason: legacy cached reader bundles that predate this sub-task will send `piece_id: null` or `undefined`; both normalise to null cleanly. A strict 400 would break every cached client until they reload. Defensive: a malformed UUID also can't be bound into the schema column (we've chosen not to add a CHECK constraint, consistent with every other join column in this codebase — a bad value there would be invisible clutter rather than a sev-0 corruption). Falling back to null keeps the bad value out of `piece_id` entirely.

5. **Keep `piece_date` required for `course_slug='daily'`; `piece_id` stays optional.** The existing `piece_date` required-validation at [chat.ts:83](../src/pages/api/zita/chat.ts:83) is the primary scope signal for `zita_messages` (piece_date column has been populated since migration 0012). `piece_id` layers on top for observer-event routing only. Making `piece_id` required now would 400 every legacy cached client; making it required later (after cache turns over ~7d) is cheaper if it turns out to matter. Observer events still route correctly when present and fall back cleanly when absent.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pre-migration-0020 observer events (written before 2026-04-22) remain null-piece_id and are now invisible on per-piece admin pages. Acceptable — they're historical clutter that was never really "about" a specific piece in a reliable way, and the day-window query that surfaced them was already wrong at multi-per-day.
- Observer events for Zita chats initiated by a legacy cached client (pre-this-commit bundle) land with null piece_id. Self-healing once browsers reload the new bundle. Window of exposure = browser cache turnover ≤ ~7d.
- No backfill of null-piece_id observer_events rows attempted. Reason: most existing null rows are legitimately non-piece (rate-limit, admin settings, server errors); guessing piece_id for the rest from (created_at, date-window) intersection would be noisy and the result low-value (historical forensics the ops team doesn't actually reach for). If we ever need to close this, a migration can backfill by matching `created_at` against `daily_pieces.published_at` windows — cheaper after the fact than preemptively.

**Files:** EDIT [`src/pages/daily/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/daily/[date]/[slug].astro), [`src/layouts/LessonLayout.astro`](../src/layouts/LessonLayout.astro), [`src/interactive/zita-chat.ts`](../src/interactive/zita-chat.ts), [`src/pages/api/zita/chat.ts`](../src/pages/api/zita/chat.ts), [`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro). EDIT [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (sub-task 3.2 entry under Area 3).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm build` clean.
- Preview `localhost:4321/daily/2026-04-17/...`: `<zita-chat>` has `piece-id="59a7f53b-9a32-443e-bfa3-27af4471bbff"` attribute; submitting a message captures POST body with `piece_id` field populated.
- Seeded 3 observer_events locally (one with matching piece_id, one null piece_id, one other piece's piece_id). Curled admin piece page: only the matching piece_id event rendered; stats row shows "1 event"; null-piece_id system event and other-piece event correctly absent.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-24: Area 3 sub-task 3.1 — Compress admin piece-detail page

**Context:** `/dashboard/admin/piece/<date>/<slug>/` is dense — timeline, every audit round expanded, up to 50 scanner candidates, all observer events, audio rows, the raw-JSON dumps, and (on traffic-heavy pieces) 40+ Zita messages. At ~9 pieces today the wall is tolerable; at 50 it's painful; at 365 it's unusable. First sub-task of the Area 3 arc.

**Decisions:**

1. **Compact summary card at top; forensic sections collapsed by default.** Single flex-wrap stat row now carries: Voice · words · beats · rounds · Facts · Audio status · event count · Zita message count · candidate count · Published · quality flag. Everything the operator previously had to scroll to pick up is now a glance at the top. The forensic sections (pipeline timeline, audit rounds, audio, scanner candidates, Zita, observer events) each wrap in a native `<details>` with the section heading as its `<summary>`, plus a status badge carrying per-section counts. Raw data dumps were already `<details>` — left untouched.

2. **Audio section smart-opens when `!audioComplete`.** Everywhere-fine is the scannable default; broken is where we save the click. An operator landing on a page because "something's wrong with audio" should not have to click into the Audio section to reach the Continue / Start over / per-beat Regenerate affordances. When `has_audio = 1`, the section collapses with a "published ✓" status badge. Every other state (partial rows, failed step, pending, zero rows) opens by default. Implementation: `<details open={!audioComplete}>`.

3. **Status badges in every `<summary>` — honest at a glance.** Each section header carries enough information to decide whether to expand:
   - Pipeline timeline — `N steps`
   - Audit rounds — `N rounds · final voice X/100`
   - Audio — `complete` / `partial (N/M beats)` / `failed` / `pending`
   - Scanner candidates — `N candidates · picked: "headline"`
   - Questions from readers — `N convos · M messages`
   - Observer events — `N events · K warn · L escalation` (severities coloured — escalation in gold, warn in text, info-only in muted)

4. **Native `<details>` over any JS accordion.** Zero runtime cost, keyboard-navigable for free, matches the existing "How this was made" drawer pattern on reader daily-piece pages. Session-local expand state is the native behaviour — no persistence needed per the sub-task spec. Triangle indicator (`▸` with `group-open:rotate-90`) mirrors the existing per-step timeline details pattern already in the same file.

5. **Zita action row (Run synthesis button, All Zita activity link) moves inside the details body.** Previously a right-justified action row lived in the section header. Putting interactive elements inside `<summary>` fights the click-to-toggle interaction. Moved into the first line of the collapsed body — one click to open the section already surfaces the row, and the expand itself is now the first-step of running synthesis.

6. **Retry button IDs and JS logic untouched.** `audio-retry-btn`, `audio-retry-fresh-btn`, `zita-synth-btn`, `.audio-regen-beat-btn` — all still present, all still in the DOM regardless of `<details>` open state, so the `addEventListener` wires at page load work unchanged. Clicking them still requires the section to be open, which is why Audio smart-opens when broken.

**Trade-offs:**
- The eyebrow (tier label above the headline) and the stat row both carry "Audio {status}" adjacent to each other — mild redundancy. Accepted: the eyebrow carries editorial tier (Polished / Solid / Rough / LOW), the stat chip carries operational audio state. Different axes, both scannable.
- Summary badge counts don't reflect filter state — at 50+ candidates or 40+ Zita messages, clicking in still requires reading the full expanded list. Text filter for these is out of scope for 3.1; it belongs in a later sub-task if it becomes painful.
- Previously-visible "Observer events this day" detail is one click away now. Justified: at multi-per-day cadence the events list is already scoped by piece_id (migration 0020, 2026-04-22) so scrolling through legacy day-window clutter was itself a partial UX regression; 3.2 tightens the scope further.
- Stat row wraps on mobile — verified via flex-wrap gap-y; slightly taller hero block, no horizontal overflow.

**Files:** EDIT [`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro) (stat-row extension + 6 section wraps + summary derivations). EDIT [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (new Area 3 section).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm build` clean.
- Curl-based render check against seeded local D1 (admin session cookie, 2026-04-17 QVC piece with 5 pipeline steps / 3 audits / 3 candidates / 3 zita rows / 3 observer events spread across severities):
  - 6 top-level section `<details>` present + 3 raw-data `<details>` = 9 total.
  - Status badges render correctly on every section.
  - Audio OPEN when `has_audio=0`, CLOSED when `has_audio=1` — verified by flipping the column and re-curling.
  - Stats row reads: `Voice 88/100 · 1400 words · 6 beats · 1 round · Facts passed · Audio pending · 3 events · 3 Zita msgs · 3 candidates · Published …`.
- Retry button JS untouched; IDs still wire.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (late evening): Area 2 sub-task 2.6 — "13 → 14 agents" cascade

**Context:** Categoriser shipped in 2.2, seeded in 2.3, surfaced in 2.4. Every living doc that named the roster count is now wrong. One atomic sweep to catch all of them.

**Decisions:**

1. **Cascade shape: find every "13" / "thirteen" in living docs + book; decide case-by-case; update live claims, leave historical narrative.** Grep-driven, not mechanical replace. Three classes of hit:
   - Live claims (README "14 agents scan the news", AGENTS.md "14 agents total", CLAUDE.md current-state summary, book chapter that enumerates the roles): **update**.
   - Historical narrative (DECISIONS entries, FOLLOWUPS archive entries, docs/handoff original specs, CLAUDE.md bullets describing specific past commits): **leave**. These describe a past state; rewriting them would falsify the record.
   - Code comments / source (tts-normalize.ts's word-number lookup table contains "thirteen" as an English number word): **leave** — unrelated to agent count.

2. **Book chapter 09 rename, not edit-in-place.** `09-the-thirteen-roles.md` → `09-the-fourteen-roles.md` via `git mv` so history follows. Title updated, intro count updated ("fourteen specific roles"), Categoriser section slotted between Learner (12) and Observer (renumbered to 14). The "Plus one more thing" aside originally said "not a fourteenth agent" about Drafter's reflect method — with Categoriser now being the 14th, rephrased to "not a fifteenth agent" so the argument (reflect is a second method on Drafter, not a new agent) still reads correctly. The "agent-ness" breakdown in chapter 06 updated too: 7 real agents + 6 workers → 8 real agents + 6 workers (Categoriser is a Claude-using agent, joins the real-agents list).

3. **Chapter 06's opening sentence updates from "13 AI agents on a website" to "14 AI agents on a website".** The rhetorical point is the same — "the word agent has had a rough year" — the number is just illustrative. Updating it keeps the chapter in sync with the rest of the book.

4. **Chapter 14's "README says thirteen AI agents" updated to "fourteen".** The quote was descriptive, not load-bearing: the chapter's argument about closing-the-loop doesn't depend on the count. Updating keeps book ↔ README consistent so a reader cross-referencing doesn't see a mismatch.

5. **Cross-chapter references all updated.** `05-ai-models.md` ("system has fourteen roles"), `10-a-day-in-the-life.md` ("Chapter 9 introduced the fourteen roles"), `17-zita-the-deep-agent.md` ("Zita — of all fourteen roles"), `99-glossary.md` (Agent definition + Durable Object definition). `CONTENTS.md` gets the new chapter title. Every link from another chapter to `09-the-thirteen-roles.md` would have been invalid after the file rename — grep confirmed none existed (chapter 9 is only referenced by narrative prose, not `./09-the-thirteen-roles.md` links).

6. **CLAUDE.md's old "Agent count in docs/book" paragraph rewritten.** It previously said "AGENT_COUNT is 14 in code, forward-looking; book + README still say thirteen until Task 10/22 actually add the new agents." That was the correct stance when it was written (only Categoriser didn't exist yet). With 2.2 having shipped Categoriser and 2.6 shipping the cascade, the stance is now "everything is synced." Rewrite reflects that and names the rename explicitly so future maintainers know where the "thirteen roles" file went.

7. **CLAUDE.md's `Database (D1 — 14 tables, 20 migrations)` section updated to `16 tables, 21 migrations`.** The 2.1 schema ship updated the top-level SCHEMA.md but not this CLAUDE.md summary. Caught in this pass; added a `Categoriser:` row listing `categories` + `piece_categories`.

8. **AGENT_COUNT constant unchanged at `14`.** Already the value since the 2026-04-23 evening sweep (commit 6592b6a). Homepage footer + MadeBy drawer + BaseLayout OG description already show 14 — verified in preview during this cascade. No code change needed; just the doc/book cascade.

**Trade-offs:**
- Rename loses file-path stability — any external link to `09-the-thirteen-roles.md` breaks. Git's rename detection keeps blame/history intact for internal tooling; external links (if any existed) 404. Acceptable because the book isn't deployed as a linked URL surface yet (it lives in the repo only).
- Keeping historical DECISIONS/FOLLOWUPS narrative at "13" means a new reader sees inconsistency between history and current. Documented in CLAUDE.md's "Agent count" paragraph so the intent is explicit: history is frozen, living docs are current.
- The book's `06-agents.md` "rated by agent-ness" list got Categoriser appended at the end of the "real agents" group rather than inserted in running order. Accepted — the order inside the list is narrative, not hierarchical, and alphabetical/chronological insertion would have disrupted the rhythm.

**Files:** RENAME `book/09-the-thirteen-roles.md` → `book/09-the-fourteen-roles.md` (title + intro + Categoriser section + numbering + closing). EDIT `book/00-preface.md`, `book/05-ai-models.md`, `book/06-agents.md` (rhetoric + rated-by-agent-ness list), `book/10-a-day-in-the-life.md`, `book/14-closing-the-loop.md`, `book/17-zita-the-deep-agent.md`, `book/99-glossary.md` (2 definitions), `book/CONTENTS.md` (chapter title + link). EDIT `README.md` (opening + "14 agents framing" + AGENTS.md link), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Stage 4 header), `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (directory listing). EDIT `CLAUDE.md` (intro, current-state, agent-team list with Categoriser at #13 + Observer at #14, database section counts + new Categoriser row, Agent-count-in-docs/book paragraph rewrite, sub-task 2.6 entry added to Area 2 block).

**Verification:**
- `grep -nE "thirteen|\\b13 agents|\\b13 roles|\\b13 AI"` across living docs returns only historical-narrative hits (verified each manually).
- Book chapter 09 renders the 14-section enumeration cleanly — Categoriser section in the same voice as neighbouring Learner/Observer sections.
- Preview at localhost:4321: homepage footer reads "Made by 14 agents."
- `pnpm build` clean.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (late evening): Area 2 sub-task 2.5 — Admin categories page DEFERRED

**Context:** Sub-task 2.5 of the Area 2 plan was an admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/categories/` with rename / merge / delete / lock controls, each action firing an `admin_category_*` observer event. Scoped and ready to build. Zishan called the deferral at the handoff point, before any 2.5 code was written.

**Decision:** Defer. Do not drop.

**Why:** The autonomous ethos runs this project. Categoriser's reuse-bias prevention (strong prompt + slug-collision fallback + ≥60 confidence floor) is the primary strategy for taxonomy health. Admin curation is the fallback for when the primary strategy doesn't hold. Shipping the fallback before observing the primary on real pieces would be (a) premature optimisation of a problem we haven't seen, (b) a subtle contradiction of "autonomous publisher" — the first admin UI for a brand-new agent says we expect to distrust it, and (c) a distraction from watching the system live its first real week. The system's bias is correct: watch, then intervene.

**What's live and what's not:**
- Live: `categories` + `piece_categories` tables (migration 0021), CategoriserAgent end-to-end, `src/lib/categories.ts` helpers, library filter at `/library/` and `/library/<slug>/`, `/categorise-trigger` admin endpoint for manual retag.
- Not live: any UI for mutating category rows. In an emergency `wrangler d1 execute` is the lever (no audit trail, no reassign-across-piece-categories rewrite — operator hand-writes the SQL).

**Unblock criteria:** (a) drift observed in production — Categoriser creates a category an operator wants renamed, or produces a second category that should have reused an existing one. (b) Catalogue reaches ~30 pieces (point at which the v0 taxonomy will likely need a pruning pass regardless of drift). Either triggers 2.5; whichever comes first.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- No audit trail on `wrangler d1 execute` interventions between now and 2.5 landing. Acceptable because those interventions should be rare; if they become frequent, that's the unblock signal.
- A bad category name set by Categoriser v1 persists forever in the URL (`/library/<slug>/`) until renamed. Acceptable for the same reason — if we need rename frequently, that's signal that the agent needs prompt tuning OR that 2.5 should land. We won't fix one-off ugliness with a deferred UI.
- Reader-facing library URLs bake in today's taxonomy. If we later rename a category via the admin UI (when it lands), old bookmarks may 404 unless the UI preserves slug history. Flag for 2.5's design when it resumes.

**Files:** EDIT [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (2.5 marked deferred with rationale), EDIT [docs/FOLLOWUPS.md](./FOLLOWUPS.md) (new `[observing]` entry with resumption hints).

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (late evening): Area 2 sub-task 2.4 — Library category filter

**Context:** Data is in place (2.1 schema, 2.2 agent, 2.3 backfill — 7 categories across 9 pieces). 2.4 surfaces it. Readers get a chip bar on `/library/` to browse by category.

**Decisions:**

1. **Sub-route `/library/<slug>/` over query param `/library/?cat=<slug>`.** Both are shareable, both were cheap. Sub-route wins on URL cleanliness + SEO signal (it's a distinct canonical page for each category). Cost was one extra .astro file; ~80% of the layout lives in a shared `<CategoryChips>` component so the duplication is contained.

2. **Both library routes switched to SSR (`prerender = false`).** Categories live in D1, not in the content collection — prerendering would need a build-time D1 proxy which is fragile. SSR cost is modest: each library render adds 2 D1 queries (~5ms each at the edge). `getCollection('dailyPieces')` still works in SSR mode since Astro content collections are bundled into the worker at build time. Same pattern `/dashboard/admin.astro` and `/dashboard/index.astro` already use.

3. **`getCategories()` filters `piece_count > 0`.** Empty categories can exist transiently after a sub-task 2.5 merge (source just went to 0, about to be deleted). A chip linking to a view with zero pieces is a dead end. The admin categories page will show them; the reader surface hides them.

4. **`CategoryChips.astro` as a shared component.** Same chip bar markup on both routes — pulling it into a single component means the render rule ("All pieces" pinned first + categories sorted by count) lives in one place. Active-chip detection via `aria-current="page"` (accessibility-correct + CSS-targetable).

5. **Chip styling: 44px min-height, flex-wrap, rounded-full pill shape.** 44px is the Apple HIG / WCAG 2.2 minimum touch target. `flex-wrap` lets the bar grow as the taxonomy does without horizontal scroll on mobile (verified at 375×812: chips stack across 3 rows at current 4-chip count, will scale cleanly to 20+ chips later). Rounded-full pill is the existing app idiom (matches Zita's UI, the admin settings page). Active state uses solid `zee-primary` bg; idle state uses transparent bg + `zee-border` outline. `title={description}` on each chip surfaces the description on desktop hover without cluttering the bar.

6. **Route-layer slug validation.** `/library/[slug].astro` validates `slug` against `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,58}[a-z0-9]$` before hitting D1 — same kebab rule Categoriser enforces via `normaliseSlug`. Malformed input (double dashes, leading/trailing dashes, unicode, >60 chars) 404s fast with zero DB load. `getCategoryBySlug()` returns null on a valid-shape but unknown slug → also 404 via `return new Response('Not found', { status: 404 })`.

7. **Filter view shows `getCollection` filtered by `pieceIds` Set, not a D1 piece-row fetch.** `piece_categories` gives the set of piece_ids for a slug; content collection gives per-piece frontmatter. Joining in-memory via `Set.has(pieceId)` avoids a SELECT-JOIN across D1 for metadata the worker already has. Cost: content collection is bundled into the worker, memory use is trivial at current n=9; at n=10000 a SELECT-JOIN would start winning but that's years away.

8. **Text filter preserved on the filtered view.** Operates within the subset — placeholder reads "Filter within this category…" so reader knows the scope. Same client-side JS logic. If the category has ≤2 pieces the filter input is hidden (same rule as the unfiltered view).

9. **Stat line on unfiltered view now shows "N categories" alongside "N pieces" and "N subjects".** Cheap signal that the taxonomy exists; grows as categories do.

**Trade-offs:**
- SSR on library pages gives up static-HTML edge caching for the reader path. Accepted — library is a low-traffic page vs daily piece reads, and the D1 query cost is well under human perception.
- Filtered view re-fetches all pieces via `getCollection` then filters in-memory. At very large catalogue sizes (10k+) this would become wasteful; at 9 pieces (today) or even 3 years × 2/day = ~2200 pieces, the bundled content collection is small and the join is fine. Revisit if the catalogue ever gets into the five-figure range.
- `piece_count=0` categories disappear from the reader-facing chip bar but stay in `categories`. The admin categories page (sub-task 2.5) surfaces them so operators can delete them after a merge.
- Two `.astro` files share ~60 lines of list-rendering markup. Chose duplication over a third shared component because list rendering tangles with month-grouping state that would bloat the component's prop surface. Mild code smell; acceptable at this file count.
- Local dev mode needed migration 0021 applied locally + test seed rows for the chip bar to render in preview. Not a prod issue (remote D1 has the real data). Noted so future contributors know why `library/` looks empty on a fresh local dev unless seeded.

**Files:** NEW [src/lib/categories.ts](../src/lib/categories.ts) (three query helpers). NEW [src/components/CategoryChips.astro](../src/components/CategoryChips.astro) (chip bar component). NEW [src/pages/library/[slug].astro](../src/pages/library/[slug].astro) (filtered view, SSR). EDIT [src/pages/library/index.astro](../src/pages/library/index.astro) (now SSR, renders chips, stat line gains category count). EDIT [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (Area 2 2.4 entry).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm build` clean with the new routes.
- Typecheck clean on every new/touched file.
- Preview at localhost:4321: `/library/` renders chip bar with 4 chips (All pieces + 3 seeded categories), stat line shows "9 pieces · 9 subjects · 3 categories", active chip on "All pieces".
- Click into `/library/chokepoints-and-supply/`: 3 pieces listed (Hormuz open, jet fuel, Hormuz halt), breadcrumb reads "Library · Chokepoints & Supply", category description renders, active chip moves to "Chokepoints & Supply".
- Mobile viewport (375×812): chips wrap cleanly across 3 rows, 44px touch targets honoured, filter input full-width.
- Desktop viewport: chips on one row at current 4-chip count, hover state works.
- 404 cases: `/library/does-not-exist/` → 404 via unknown-slug path; `/library/BAD..SLUG/` → 404 via slug-shape validation. Both before any DB round-trip.
- Zero server errors in dev log across ~10 page loads.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (late evening): Area 2 sub-task 2.3 — Seed existing pieces

**Context:** With Categoriser wired (2.2), every *new* piece gets categorised at publish+1s. But the 9 pre-Categoriser pieces (2026-04-17 → 2026-04-23) have no rows in `piece_categories` — they'd appear nowhere under the library filter (2.4) until manually retagged. 2.3 is the one-time backfill that (a) catches up the historical pieces and (b) builds the initial taxonomy from real pieces rather than a guessed seed list.

**Decisions:**

1. **One-shot shell script at `scripts/seed-categories.sh`.** Matches existing convention (`reset-today.sh`, `post-build.sh`). Uses the same wrangler+curl+node-for-JSON-parsing pattern reset-today.sh established. No new TS toolchain overhead; no extension-case bikeshed.

2. **Sequential by `published_at ASC`, not parallel or reverse.** Categoriser's reuse-bias only works if it can see previously-created categories in the SELECT before running. Sequential means piece N completes its categorisation + commits to `categories` before piece N+1's categoriser reads the list. Oldest-first means the earliest pieces (when the taxonomy was empty) did most of the category creation work; every subsequent piece saw a growing list and reused where it fit. Reverse would have concentrated novelty at the end and left earlier pieces looking for non-existent subjects.

3. **Idempotent at three layers.** (a) Script pre-check per piece — `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM piece_categories WHERE piece_id = ?` skips already-done pieces, avoids the HTTP round-trip. (b) Agent pre-insert guard — same check inside `CategoriserAgent.categorise` returns `skipped: true` + no Claude call. (c) Composite PK `(piece_id, category_id)` on the table blocks duplicate rows even if layers (a) + (b) were bypassed. Re-running the script is a safe no-op on completed pieces and only acts on newly-added or admin-wiped ones. Verified: second run on all 9 pieces emitted 9 `already categorised, skipping` lines with zero HTTP calls.

4. **Poll-for-completion between pieces, not fixed sleep.** Categoriser's `/categorise-trigger` returns 202 immediately (fire-and-forget via `ctx.waitUntil`) — the actual Claude call + writes happen asynchronously. If piece N+1 fires before piece N completes, N+1's SELECT misses N's new categories, collapsing the reuse-bias. Script polls `piece_categories` every 3s with a 90s timeout per piece — each piece takes 3–10s wall-clock in practice. Fixed-sleep alternatives (20s or 30s) would either starve the polling (if Claude is slow) or waste 10s × 9 pieces on the happy path. Polling is load-bearing here.

5. **Per-piece assignment summary on completion.** Prints the slug + confidence for each assignment as the piece finishes (`resource-constraints-tradeoffs@75`, `policy-design-implementation@90`). Operator gets a real-time read of the taxonomy that's emerging instead of waiting for the tail summary. Makes obvious when the agent's reuse bias is working (early pieces create categories, later pieces reuse them).

6. **`DRY_RUN=1` preview mode.** Skips the HTTP call entirely; prints what *would* fire. Useful before first run to sanity-check the piece ordering and count. No secret required for the dry run — only fetches from D1, no writes.

7. **`ADMIN_SECRET` rotation this session.** Secret was write-only-by-design and unavailable at script-run time. Rotated via `openssl rand -hex 32` → `wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET` on agents worker + `wrangler secret put AGENTS_ADMIN_SECRET` on site worker (names differ by worker but carry the same value). Brief rotation window (~5s between the two `secret put` commands) is safe at 23:40 UTC — no pipeline running, no audio-retry UI in use, zero cross-worker API traffic.

**First-run result (all 9 pre-Categoriser pieces, 2026-04-23 late evening):**
- 11 total assignments (8 pieces with 1 category, 2 pieces with 2 categories — the two legitimately-spanning ones).
- 7 categories emerged:
  - `chokepoints-and-supply` (3 pieces) — Hormuz open, Hormuz halt, jet fuel
  - `commodity-shocks` (2) — jet fuel, Hormuz halt
  - `policy-design-implementation` (2) — tobacco ban, cannabis reclass
  - `business-model-disruption` (1) — QVC
  - `infrastructure-technical-debt` (1) — ATC modernisation
  - `resource-constraints-tradeoffs` (1) — NASA Voyager 1 shutdown
  - `trade-policy-mechanics` (1) — tariff refunds
- Every category name is a *subject* not a topic-of-the-week (no "Cannabis Reclassification" or "Iran Tensions" labels). Reuse-bias held: both Hormuz pieces reused the Chokepoints + Commodity categories from the oil + jet fuel pieces rather than proliferating Iran-specific categories. Tobacco + cannabis both went to Policy Design & Implementation, not drug-specific categories.
- 9 `Categorised: …` observer events (severity=info), zero failures. Zero `skipped` on first run.
- Idempotency confirmed: second run skipped all 9 with zero HTTP calls.

**Trade-offs:**
- 90s per-piece poll timeout means a slow Claude response (or a network hiccup) stalls the whole backfill at that piece. Acceptable — the script exits 1 on timeout and lists the failed piece, operator reruns. At n=9 this runs <1min total on the happy path; at n=100 it'd be ~5–10min which is still fine for a one-shot.
- Script requires `ADMIN_SECRET` in the shell. Per `feedback_admin_ui_over_shell_secret` this is the "automation belongs in wrangler/CI" exception — there's no admin-UI path for bulk backfill and creating one just for this use case would be overkill. The `/categorise-trigger` endpoint exists primarily for this script plus the future 2.5 admin retag flow.
- First-run category quality depends on whatever Sonnet decides is a "durable subject" for the first piece (QVC). If it had proposed "E-commerce Disruption" instead of "Business Model Disruption", the whole taxonomy would have had a more specific flavour. Mitigation: admin UI in 2.5 gives operator rename/merge controls. Worst case is renaming a few categories, not a re-run.
- Seed run permanently captures the initial taxonomy shape in the `categories` table. If the agent prompt changes later (2.6 or beyond), re-seeding requires either deleting `piece_categories` rows + `categories` rows first (destructive, loses history), or manually merging new categories via the admin UI. Accepted — the whole point of a one-shot seed is that it's not re-run.

**Files:** NEW [scripts/seed-categories.sh](../scripts/seed-categories.sh). EDIT [docs/RUNBOOK.md](./RUNBOOK.md) (new "Seed categories across historical pieces" section). CLAUDE.md (Area 2 2.3 entry).

**Verification:** Live backfill completed 2026-04-23 late evening — 9/9 pieces fired cleanly, 11 assignments written, 7 categories in the taxonomy. Second run confirmed idempotency (9 skip lines, zero HTTP calls). 9 `Categorised: …` observer events visible in admin feed, zero warns. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM piece_categories` = 11; `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM categories` = 7. Per-piece assignments spot-checked — all 7 category names are subjects, none reference specific news events.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (late evening): Area 2 sub-task 2.2 — CategoriserAgent (14th agent)

**Context:** With schema in place (sub-task 2.1), 2.2 adds the 14th agent that actually populates it. Single-purpose agent, same off-pipeline pattern as Learner's post-publish analysis and Drafter.reflect.

**Decisions:**

1. **One file, one prompt, one method.** `agents/src/categoriser.ts` + `agents/src/categoriser-prompt.ts`. Method `categorise(pieceId, date, mdx)` returns `CategoriserResult` with per-run metrics. Same shape as Drafter.reflect — takes MDX from caller rather than re-reading from GitHub itself, keeps the agent ignorant of file paths.

2. **Director hook — scheduled alarm, not inline.** New `categoriseScheduled` method at Director fires via `this.schedule(1, 'categoriseScheduled', {pieceId, date, title, filePath})` immediately after `publishing done`. Sits right before the audio schedule so alarm ordering is deterministic (producer + self-reflection + categoriser + audio, all fire in order). Scheduled method re-reads MDX via `PublisherAgent.readPublishedMdx` — same pattern as `reflectOnPieceScheduled`, keeps scheduled-row payloads small (filePath only, not body).

3. **Strongly reuse-biased prompt.** The prompt names the anti-pattern directly — "a taxonomy that grows a new category for every piece becomes a headline list, not a map." Numeric floor: reuse when any existing category fits at confidence ≥60 (`CATEGORISER_REUSE_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`). At most one new category per call, and only for *subjects* (durable, could hold 10+ future pieces), never topic-of-the-week labels. Prompt also asks Claude to check *underlying subject* against existing descriptions, not just headline keywords — prevents "different word, same concept" splits.

4. **Novel category validation + collision guard at the agent layer.** Slug normalisation via `normaliseSlug` (lowercase, diacritic strip, non-alnum → `-`, bounded length). Pre-INSERT SELECT against `existingBySlug` → if Claude proposes a name that normalises to an existing slug, reuse that category instead of creating a duplicate. Post-INSERT try/catch — if the INSERT throws on a UNIQUE violation (race between two concurrent categoriser runs proposing the same slug), SELECT the winner and reuse its id. Name clamped to 100 chars, description to 500.

5. **`piece_count` maintained in the same transaction as `piece_categories` INSERT.** Each assignment does `INSERT INTO piece_categories` + `UPDATE categories SET piece_count = piece_count + 1, updated_at = ?`. Sub-task 2.5's merge/delete flows will decrement on the same path. Drift surface accepted; admin "Recount" is the escape hatch. D1 per-DB serial consistency makes the atomic increment safe under concurrent runs on different pieces.

6. **Idempotence at two layers.** (a) Pre-insert guard — `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM piece_categories WHERE piece_id = ?` short-circuits with `skipped: true` and no Claude call if the piece already has any rows. (b) Composite PK `(piece_id, category_id)` blocks duplicate rows underneath. The pre-check saves the cost of a Sonnet call on re-runs; the PK is the correctness floor.

7. **Locked semantic is inert for this agent.** `categories.locked = 1` means "Categoriser MUST NOT reassign AWAY from this category" (per sub-task 2.1 design). Since the agent only INSERTs — never DELETEs or re-tags — the flag has no effect on this code path. Enforced at admin-time (merge/delete in sub-task 2.5). Documented in agent header so future maintainers don't add spurious checks.

8. **Failure = logged, not retried.** Same posture as `analyseProducerSignalsScheduled` and `reflectOnPieceScheduled`: a DB / Claude / JSON parse failure surfaces via `observer.logCategoriserFailure` (warn severity) and the alarm returns. The piece is live; a missed categorisation means the library filter won't surface this piece under a category until a manual retag via the seed script or the admin UI. Piece is never blocked.

9. **Metered success logging.** `observer.logCategoriserMetered` fires on both `skipped` and written paths (info severity, same shape as `logReflectionMetered` and `logZitaSynthesisMetered`) — tokens-in/out + latency + assignments-written + novel-names. Cost drift visible over time without a separate metrics pipeline. The skipped path fires with zero tokens + DB-only latency so "did categoriser run?" has a visible answer.

10. **New admin endpoint `/categorise-trigger?piece_id=<uuid>`.** Mirrors `/zita-synthesis-trigger`. Three purposes: (a) verifying sub-task 2.2 ships green before 2.3's seed script; (b) operator retag after sub-task 2.5 admin merge/delete; (c) re-running after a Categoriser prompt change. ADMIN_SECRET bearer-gated, validates piece_id as UUID shape, resolves filePath the same way Director does at publish, fires via `ctx.waitUntil(director.categoriseScheduled(…))`. The idempotence guard in the agent makes "did it already categorise?" a safe retry.

**Trade-offs:**
- MDX excerpt capped at 2000 chars (`BODY_EXCERPT_MAX_CHARS`) — enough to show the hook + first teaching beat, keeps backfill cost predictable across 8 pieces × 3 years × 1 piece/day at scale. A 20k-char piece would bust the prompt budget without this cap. Potential cost: a piece whose categorical signal is buried past the first 2000 chars gets under-informed categorisation. Accepted; the headline + underlying_subject + first chunk carries the weight for categorisation.
- Pre-insert COUNT query adds one DB round-trip per call. At one call per piece per day, noise against the Sonnet call cost.
- `categories.piece_count` bumped on INSERT but not decremented on `piece_categories` row delete here (this agent never deletes). Decrement logic lives in sub-task 2.5's admin merge/delete paths. If a future code path deletes a piece_categories row without updating piece_count, drift happens — admin "Recount" escape hatch covers it.
- Slug collision fallback turns a proposed novel category into an existing-category reuse silently. Logged only in the returned `assignmentsWritten` count, not distinctly flagged. A misbehaving prompt returning slug-collisions every run would look like "no novel categories" in metrics; acceptable because this isn't a likely failure mode and the admin UI in 2.5 will surface the full categories list either way.
- Director schedules categoriser BEFORE audio, both at +1s and +2s. GitHub eventual consistency on freshly pushed content: a ~2s read-delay on categoriser's re-read of the just-committed MDX. Same issue the reflect schedule has — handled the same way (404 means "not yet propagated", logs failure, agent moves on; next cron run on that piece re-tries via `/categorise-trigger` or seed).
- `/categorise-trigger` endpoint bypasses the reuse bias's main intent (taxonomy stability) to the extent that operators can blindly re-categorise. Guarded in practice by ADMIN_SECRET + the agent's idempotence skip — the trigger is primarily for pieces that don't yet have categories.

**Files:** NEW [agents/src/categoriser.ts](../agents/src/categoriser.ts), NEW [agents/src/categoriser-prompt.ts](../agents/src/categoriser-prompt.ts). EDIT [agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts) (import + schedule call + categoriseScheduled alarm), [agents/src/observer.ts](../agents/src/observer.ts) (logCategoriserMetered + logCategoriserFailure), [agents/src/server.ts](../agents/src/server.ts) (export + `/categorise-trigger` endpoint), [agents/src/types.ts](../agents/src/types.ts) (`CATEGORISER` binding), [agents/wrangler.toml](../agents/wrangler.toml) (DO binding + migration tag v12). Docs: [docs/AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) (Categoriser section + endpoint doc), [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (Area 2 2.2 entry).

**Verification:** Typecheck clean on every new/touched file; server.ts still has its 18 pre-existing SubAgent errors (unchanged). `pnpm build` on the site worker clean (no cross-worker drift). Agents worker deployed successfully — `env.CATEGORISER (CategoriserAgent)` binding listed in wrangler output. Live categorisation verified via sub-task 2.3's seed script over all 8 existing pieces (next commit) — the seed script exercises the exact same `Director.categoriseScheduled` → `CategoriserAgent.categorise` path.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (late evening): Area 2 sub-task 2.1 — `categories` + `piece_categories` schema

**Context:** Area 2 opens the 14th agent — Categoriser — plus a library category filter and an admin management page. Six sub-tasks, schema-first discipline: no code that writes to these tables can land until the tables exist in production. Sub-task 2.1 is the plumbing commit.

**Decisions:**

1. **Two new tables, both additive.** `categories` holds the taxonomy (id, slug, name, description, locked, piece_count, created_at, updated_at). `piece_categories` is the join (piece_id, category_id, confidence, created_at) with composite PK `(piece_id, category_id)`. Full shape in [migrations/0021_categories.sql](../migrations/0021_categories.sql) header. Rollback = `DROP TABLE` on both — empty at migration time, no backfill to reverse.

2. **`piece_count` denormalised on `categories`.** Library chips render sorted by count on every page load (sub-task 2.4). A correlated `COUNT(pc.piece_id) GROUP BY` on each render is fine at 5 categories but ugly as the taxonomy grows; the write path (Categoriser insert, admin merge/delete) is low-frequency. Maintained by the writer; admin page gets a "Recount" escape hatch (sub-task 2.5) for drift recovery. Same defensive shape as any future migration backfill.

3. **`slug` stored, not derived from `name`.** Rename updates `name`; `slug` only changes on explicit operator edit or on merge (target's slug wins). Keeps `/library/?cat=chokepoints` URLs stable across renames — important if a library URL ever leaks into anyone's bookmark.

4. **Composite PK on `piece_categories`** gives idempotency. Categoriser can safely re-run over a piece without producing duplicate rows; the pre-insert guard on sub-task 2.2 is a correctness layer on top of this safety net.

5. **No REFERENCES FK declarations.** Consistent with every other join column across 20 prior migrations (`daily_piece_audio.piece_id`, `pipeline_log.piece_id`, `audit_results.piece_id`, `learnings.piece_id`, …). D1 doesn't enforce FKs at the schema level in this codebase; application layer owns integrity. Admin delete is gated on `piece_count=0` (sub-task 2.5) so orphans can't arise.

6. **`locked` as INTEGER (0/1), no CHECK on `confidence`.** Consistent with `has_audio`, `has_interactive`, `passed`, `applied_to_prompts` (INTEGER booleans) and `learnings.confidence` / `audit_results.score` (INTEGER 0–100, no CHECK). Application layer clamps and validates.

7. **Two indexes on `categories`, two on `piece_categories`.** `idx_categories_slug` for library route lookups (alongside the UNIQUE auto-index, harmless redundancy and makes the EXPLAIN readable). `idx_categories_piece_count` DESC for the chip-sort read path. `idx_piece_categories_piece` for per-piece lookup (per-piece admin + drawer). `idx_piece_categories_category` for per-category filter (library chip) and piece_count recount.

**Trade-offs:**
- Denormalised `piece_count` creates a drift surface (Categoriser/admin must bump + decrement correctly). Accepted — the recount escape hatch is cheap to build and the read-path win is real as the taxonomy grows.
- Stored `slug` means a rename doesn't auto-update the URL; operators must edit slug manually when they want the URL to follow. Deliberate — bookmark stability beats auto-slugging.
- `(piece_id, category_id)` PK means a piece can't appear twice in the same category even if Categoriser is re-invoked with higher confidence. Upsert pattern (`INSERT OR REPLACE`) writes the newer row on re-run; acceptable since re-runs are manual operator actions.
- No seed rows. Initial taxonomy emerges from sub-task 2.3's backfill over existing published pieces, oldest first. Avoids a guessed taxonomy that later has to unwind.

**Files:** NEW [migrations/0021_categories.sql](../migrations/0021_categories.sql). EDIT [docs/SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md) (two new table entries + migration-summary line + header counts 14→16 tables / 20→21 migrations).

**Verification:** Migration applied cleanly (`wrangler d1 migrations apply zeemish --remote` → 7 commands, 1.27ms, ✅). `PRAGMA table_info(categories)` returned 8 columns in the expected shape. `PRAGMA table_info(piece_categories)` returned 4 columns. All 4 custom indexes present (`idx_categories_slug`, `idx_categories_piece_count`, `idx_piece_categories_piece`, `idx_piece_categories_category`) alongside SQLite auto-indexes for PKs + UNIQUE slug. `SELECT COUNT(*)` on both tables returned 0 as expected.

**Commit:** next.

## 2026-04-23 (evening): Dashboard `isRunningNow` heuristic + gerund progress phrasing

**Context:** User reported `/dashboard/` was showing "Pipeline running — currently in publisher commits the audio." for today's 2026-04-23 cannabis piece, even though audio had long since completed (`has_audio=1`, commit `891c6f2` earlier in the day). Two bugs compounded.

**Decisions:**

1. **`isRunningNow` heuristic misread terminal state.** [src/pages/dashboard/index.astro:205-206](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro) checked `lastStep.step` against a terminal-NAME list (`['done', 'error', 'skipped']`). Director writes the audio success terminal as `step='audio-publishing', status='done'` ([agents/src/director.ts:885](../agents/src/director.ts:885)) — step NAME never matches `'done'`, so `!terminal` stayed true forever after audio completed. **Same bug class as commit `fc23970` (admin Pipeline History verdict, earlier today).** Fix: `isRunningNow = lastStep.run_id === today && lastStep.status === 'running';`. `status` is the canonical terminal signal; step name is not.

2. **"currently in X" grammar broke at every state.** `pipelineStepLabel` values are full subject-verb-object sentences ("Drafter writes the MDX"). Composing them into "currently in X" produced "currently in drafter writes the MDX" / "currently in publisher commits the audio" — stilted at every state, not just audio. New [`pipelineStepProgress(step)`](../src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts) helper returns gerund phrases ("writing the draft", "generating audio", "committing audio"). Round-aware for `auditing_rN` / `revising_rN` via regex. Status line now reads "Pipeline running — generating audio." cleanly. Two render sites updated: hero subtitle at [index.astro:231](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro:231) + Today status strip at [:324](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro:324).

**Trade-offs:**
- Two progress helpers now co-exist in `pipeline-steps.ts`: `pipelineStepLabel` (timeline/stepper rows — noun-phrase OK because rendered standalone) and `pipelineStepProgress` (live status lines — gerund because rendered inside a running-state sentence). Slightly redundant but the grammar demands are genuinely different; merging would force one site to degrade.
- Unknown step falls through to raw (same fallback as `pipelineStepLabel`). At current agent set every step is mapped; new steps will read "Pipeline running — {step}" until added to the map — visible enough to notice but not broken.
- The heuristic fix is identical in shape to commit `fc23970`'s fix earlier in the day. Lesson logged: when one surface reads `pipeline_log.step` as a terminal marker, audit every other surface for the same pattern in the same session.

**Files:** EDIT [src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts](../src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts), EDIT [src/pages/dashboard/index.astro](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro).

**Verification:** `pnpm build` clean. Helper unit-checked via `tsx` stub across all 10 step names + unknown fallback — every phrase reads naturally in the "Pipeline running — X." frame. Live check after deploy: today's dashboard should flip from false "running" to "Today's piece is live. 9 pieces in 7 days."

**Commit:** `dc870a1`.

## 2026-04-23 (evening): Cross-surface duplication sweep + `src/lib/learnings.ts` helper

**Context:** User-led audit of home / public dashboard / admin surfaces for content shown in more than one place. Found three confirmed dups on the public dashboard plus four stale "each morning" / "every morning" references from before `interval_hours=12` shipped. Single-session sweep.

**Decisions:**

1. **"Published —" hero vs first row of Recent Runs.** Hero says "Published — {headline} · {tier}"; Recent Runs' first row rendered the same headline with richer metadata (voice score, rounds, candidates). Both fed from `daily_pieces` where `date >= weekAgoIso`. Fix: filter `todaysPiece?.id` out of `runLog` at [index.astro:152](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro:152). Filter by `id` not `date` so at multi-per-day the second-latest same-date piece stays in the feed.

2. **"What we've learned so far" section deleted from public, counters moved to admin.** The section showed 3 counters (Producer patterns / Self-reflections / Total observations) + a blockquote with the latest learning observation. The blockquote was a verbatim duplicate of a bullet in the matching piece's How-this-was-made drawer. The counters are operator-facing signals about the learning loop — readers visiting `/dashboard/` don't gain from them. Public dashboard should describe how Zeemish works, not how much memory has accumulated. Explainer paragraph ("After every piece, two passes run…") went with the section; its mechanism description can find a home later if a "How Zeemish works" expansion happens. Pull-quote option chosen: **(a) remove, keep counters** (moved to admin). Rotating (b) needed state; aggregate (c) needed an LLM pass or human curation. Reader-facing per-piece drawer keeps its learnings list — unchanged.

3. **New section on admin: "Learning loop"** — placed between **System state** and **Observer events** on [admin.astro](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro). Three counters only; no explainer (operator knows). Flows: system-health stats → learning-loop stats → observer feed.

4. **`src/lib/learnings.ts` helper** — extracted the learning-count query into `getLearningCounts(db)`. Previous inline form issued three separate `SELECT COUNT(*)` round trips; the helper consolidates into one `SUM(CASE WHEN source = 'X' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` query. Since public is DELETING the query and admin is GAINING it, no copy-paste-forward happens in this commit — but the helper prevents the pattern from spreading the next time a surface wants these numbers ("one home per piece of information").

5. **Cadence copy sweep.** Removed "each morning" / "every morning" from four surfaces instead of parameterising: the product rhythm doesn't need to be asserted in copy when the dashboard already shows "Next run in Xh Ym". Cadence-neutral sentences stay true at any `interval_hours`. Changes: dashboard Scanner job ("Reads the news every morning" → "Reads the news for each run"), dashboard explainer (drop "13 agents, each morning" sentence — dup with footer + agent-team list directly above), homepage empty state (drop "Every morning, "), `/daily/` subhead (drop "One piece, every morning."). OG description in BaseLayout switched to use `AGENT_COUNT` template literal rather than literal "13".

6. **`MadeBy.astro` drawer subtitle uses `AGENT_COUNT`.** Previously "The pipeline of 13 agents behind this piece" — now "The pipeline of {AGENT_COUNT} agents behind this piece". Closes the bleed-through from Task 3 where the footer already read "14" via constant.

**Trade-offs:**
- Public dashboard lost a section. Sparse is fine — the remaining sections (today status, week's output, Recent Runs, How it's holding up, Agent team, How this works) are enough.
- Explainer paragraph's mechanism description ("two passes run…") was the only place on public copy where the learning loop was named. Moving to admin means a casual reader no longer learns the loop exists. Acceptable: per-piece drawer still shows "What the system learned from this piece" with source attribution.
- Admin's new Learning loop section gated on `learningCounts.total > 0` — hidden when no learnings exist (dev / bootstrap). Same defensive pattern as the prior public section.
- At `interval_hours=24` the cadence copy change ("every morning" removed) is imperceptible — current users won't notice. At 12h/4h/etc the change is what keeps the claim true.
- Book + README retain "13 agents" / "thirteen" references. Those are forensic narrative at a moment in time; rewriting them ahead of actually adding agents would be editing history. They sync when Task 10/22 land.

**Files:** NEW [src/lib/learnings.ts](../src/lib/learnings.ts); EDIT [src/pages/dashboard/index.astro](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro) (filter + delete section + cadence copy + dead-code cleanup); EDIT [src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro) (new Learning loop section + query); EDIT [src/pages/index.astro](../src/pages/index.astro) (drop "Every morning, "); EDIT [src/pages/daily/index.astro](../src/pages/daily/index.astro) (drop trailing sentence); EDIT [src/components/MadeBy.astro](../src/components/MadeBy.astro) (AGENT_COUNT); EDIT [src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro](../src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) (OG desc uses AGENT_COUNT).

**Verification:** `pnpm build` clean. Local fetch of `/`, `/daily/`, `/dashboard/` confirms zero "13 agents" / "every morning" / "What we've learned so far" strings on any surface. Piece-page drawer subtitle renders "14 agents" correctly. Admin Learning loop section's D1 path not locally verifiable (requires ADMIN_EMAIL + seeded learnings); build-clean is the right level for the template change. Hero + Recent Runs dedup is a 1-line filter change on a piece_id comparison — trivially correct.

**Commit:** `7312ee0`.

## 2026-04-23 (evening): Homepage "made by N agents" strip moves to site footer + `AGENT_COUNT` constant

**Context:** Homepage had a transparency strip between today's hero and the Recent list: "Made by 13 agents. Today's piece moved through Scanner → Curator → Drafter → Voice · Facts · Structure → Publisher before going live. See the pipeline →". Cramped; competing with the teaching hero. Home's job is surfacing today's teaching — the pipeline's home is the Dashboard.

**Decisions:**

1. **Strip removed from homepage body.** [src/pages/index.astro:70-79](../src/pages/index.astro) deleted.

2. **Tiny footer pointer added to `BaseLayout.astro`.** Three centered lines: tagline / "Made by {AGENT_COUNT} agents." / copyright. Site-wide (every page), not homepage-only — matches "the footer" phrasing and DRY. Minor redundancy on `/dashboard/` itself where the "See the pipeline →" link would self-reference; chose to drop the link entirely and keep just the "Made by N agents." statement. Footer stays tiny.

3. **New `src/lib/constants.ts` with `AGENT_COUNT`.** No shared constant existed previously; "13" was hardcoded in 4 places (homepage strip, MadeBy drawer subtitle, BaseLayout OG description, dashboard explainer). Constant set to **14** per user direction — more agents are planned in Task 10/22, docs + agent-team list update alongside when those land. The other three surfaces stay on literal "13" pending those tasks (the cluster-extend happens in Task 4's duplication sweep same-session).

4. **Scope:** only the footer pointer uses the constant in this commit. Task 4 (same session, later commit) extends to MadeBy + OG + dashboard explainer.

**Trade-offs:**
- `AGENT_COUNT = 14` vs actual 13-file roster creates a temporary mismatch: public dashboard's agent-team list still shows 13 cards while the footer claims "14 agents". User accepted this ("more agents will come, we will update the docs"). The footer is the forward-looking claim; the team list is the current literal truth. Honesty gap closes when Task 10 adds the 14th agent.
- Mobile footer is three stacked centered lines (verified via preview resize to 375px). No horizontal overflow; reads clean.

**Files:** NEW [src/lib/constants.ts](../src/lib/constants.ts); EDIT [src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro](../src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro); EDIT [src/pages/index.astro](../src/pages/index.astro).

**Verification:** `pnpm build` clean. `preview_start` + `preview_resize mobile` confirmed the footer renders three lines, strip gone from body, zero console errors.

**Commit:** `6592b6a`.

## 2026-04-23 (evening): Kebab-case step names no longer leak in timelines + steppers

**Context:** "How this was made" drawer timeline, admin Today's Run stepper, and per-piece admin timeline all route step names through `pipelineStepLabel()` — but the map had no entries for `audio-producing`, `audio-auditing`, `audio-publishing`. Those three rendered as raw kebab-case alongside the human-written labels ("Scanner reads the news", "Drafter writes the MDX"). Same list, two voices.

**Decisions:**

1. **Three entries added to `PIPELINE_STEP_LABELS`** in [src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts](../src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts):
   - `audio-producing` → "Audio Producer narrates the beats"
   - `audio-auditing` → "Audio Auditor checks the files"
   - `audio-publishing` → "Publisher commits the audio"
   Fall-through behaviour preserved (unknown steps still render raw — visible enough to notice, not broken).

2. **Admin Pipeline History verdict routes step name through `pipelineStepLabel`.** The verdict fix in commit `fc23970` (earlier same day) rendered "Errored at audio-publishing" / "Running · audio-publishing" / "Stalled at scanning" using the raw step name — a new kebab leak I introduced in that fix. [admin.astro:440](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro:440) now wraps `step` in `stepLabel = pipelineStepLabel(step)` before composing verdicts. "Errored at Publisher commits the audio" reads slightly long but is consistent with every other admin surface.

**Other leaks swept** (and found clean):
- Observer event titles ([observer.ts:130,149,296](../agents/src/observer.ts:130)) — already human ("Audio published: {title}", "Audio failure: {title}").
- Raw step strings in [admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro:377-380](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro:377) — internal comparisons only, not rendered.
- 5 consumers of `pipelineStepLabel` (made-drawer, admin home stepper, per-piece admin timeline, public dashboard's "currently in X" hero and status strip) all inherit the new entries automatically.

**Trade-offs:**
- "Errored at Publisher commits the audio" is 5 words; the raw kebab was 2. Length cost accepted because (a) consistency across admin > terseness, (b) the verdict line is rare (only for failed/running/stalled runs, not Done/Skipped), (c) the text wraps gracefully.

## 2026-04-23 (evening): Admin Pipeline History verdict reads `finalStatus`, not step name

**Context:** Admin home's "Pipeline history (last 14 runs)" panel showed "Stalled at audio-publishing" for every healthy recent run — the indicator had lost its signal. Audio was actually landing (`has_audio=1`, piece audio played live), so the "Stalled" label was false.

**Root cause:** the query at [admin.astro:182-196](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro:182) picked `MAX(created_at)` pipeline_log row per piece. For a healthy run with audio, that row is `step='audio-publishing', status='done'` (Director's terminal write at [director.ts:885](../agents/src/director.ts:885)). The verdict logic at [:440](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro:440) only checked step *name*:
```js
const ok = r.finalStep === 'done';
const verdict = ok ? 'Done' : skipped ? 'Skipped' : (r.finalStep === 'error' ? 'Errored' : `Stalled at ${r.finalStep}`);
```
Step name was `audio-publishing`, not the literal `'done'` — so every healthy run fell through to "Stalled at audio-publishing". The `finalStep === 'error'` branch was also dead: no director.ts logStep writes a step literally named `'error'`.

**Decisions:**

1. **Verdict now reads `finalStatus`.** Status is Director's canonical terminal signal; `'done'` = success, `'failed'` = errored, `'running'` = in-flight. Step name describes WHAT step, not WHETHER terminal.
```js
const skipped = step === 'skipped';
const errored = status === 'failed';
const running = status === 'running';
const ok = status === 'done' && !skipped;
const verdict = ok ? 'Done'
  : skipped ? 'Skipped'
  : errored ? `Errored at ${step}`
  : running ? `Running · ${step}`
  : `Stalled at ${step}`;
```

2. **Pipeline History kept (not removed).** Audit confirmed it's not duplicating "All pieces" or "Recent runs": it's the only admin surface that shows runs with no successful publish (scanner-skipped, errored before publish). All pieces excludes those; Recent runs is a reader-facing summary.

3. **Added running-vs-stalled distinction.** Previously "Stalled" was the catch-all for any non-terminal step name. Now "Running · {step}" fires when `status='running'` (actually in flight); "Stalled" only for genuine unknowns (status not done/failed/running).

**Trade-offs:**
- Verdict reads raw step name ("Errored at audio-publishing"). A new kebab-case leak, fixed same-session in commit `fafdc5c`.
- `errored` branch uses `status='failed'`. Matches director.ts writes. No agent writes `status='error'` — that dead check was removed.

**Files:** EDIT [src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro).

**Verification:** `pnpm build` clean. Live: after deploy, recent healthy runs show "Done" (not "Stalled at audio-publishing"); failed runs show "Errored at {step}" with the specific failure point visible.

**Commit:** `fc23970`.

## 2026-04-23 (cont.): Two cleanups surfaced by live verification of the audio-retry surface

**Context:** Live Start-over test on the 2026-04-23 cannabis piece passed but surfaced two small issues during mid-run inspection. Neither blocked the pipeline — the run completed healthy end-to-end — but both are visible quality-of-life bugs worth fixing while the context is fresh.

1. **Admin retry block displayed stale failure reason from a prior run.** Screenshot captured mid-Start-over showed "Audio pipeline failed at audio-producing — Durable Object reset because its code was updated." The `audio-producing failed` row it surfaced was from **6 hours earlier** (14:02:11 UTC, during the original publish run before today's deploy), not from the healthy Start-over run that was in flight (started 20:11:21 UTC). Root cause: `audioFailureStep = pipeline.find((p) => p.step.startsWith('audio-') && p.status === 'failed')` in [`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro) had no time filter. Pre-existing bug since commit `3208c86` on 2026-04-22 — **not** a regression from today's always-visible-retry change (earlier framing was guessing; git log showed the unfiltered query was untouched by today's commit). Fix: compute `latestAudioRunStart` from the most recent `audio-producing running` row, then filter failures to `created_at >= latestAudioRunStart`. Historical failures from prior runs no longer surface as current.

2. **Publisher made pure-reorder commits on per-beat regen and Start over.** Director's `SELECT beat_name, public_url FROM daily_piece_audio WHERE piece_id = ? ORDER BY generated_at ASC` built the `audioBeats` frontmatter map in generation order. On per-beat regen, the regen'd beat's `generated_at` was newest, so it moved to the bottom of the map — same URLs, different order, triggering Publisher's byte-comparison to see a diff and make a noisy reorder-only commit. Two such commits landed today for the cannabis piece (`d6cfb55` per-beat, `d94754f` Start-over). Fix: change SELECT to `ORDER BY beat_name ASC` so the map serialises deterministically regardless of which beat was regenerated most recently. Readers unaffected — site consumes `audioBeats` by key lookup, not map order. First pipeline run after this fix produces one last reorder commit (one-time cost), then Publisher's idempotent check fires correctly for all subsequent per-beat regens where URLs are unchanged.

**Files:** EDIT [src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro), EDIT [agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts).

**Verification:** `pnpm build` clean, agents typecheck no new errors (same 18 pre-existing server.ts SubAgent errors plus the one `retryAudioBeat` instance from the morning commit). Live verification: on the next Start-over, the stale "Durable Object reset" should no longer display — mid-run shows "Audio incomplete — expected N beats, have M" instead. On the next per-beat regen where URLs are unchanged, Publisher should skip the commit entirely.

## 2026-04-23: Provider-agnostic TTS normaliser + admin per-beat audio regen

**Context:** The 2026-04-23 cannabis piece ("Trump Administration Reclassifies Cannabis…") contains dense Roman numerals — "Schedule I, II, III, IV and V". ElevenLabs reads single-letter Roman numerals as English letter names: `I` becomes the pronoun "I", `V` becomes the letter "V". The issue is at the TTS layer, not the writing, and will recur for any Roman-numeral-heavy piece (amendments, monarchs, chapters) regardless of which audio provider we use. Separately, the admin per-piece page hides the audio retry buttons the moment `has_audio = 1` — so there's no affordance to refresh an already-published piece after a pipeline-level fix like this one, and no per-beat surgical option.

**Decisions + shipping:**

1. **New module `agents/src/shared/tts-normalize.ts`.** Single `normalizeForTTS(text)` export. Three passes: multi-char standalone Roman numerals (`III` → `three`) always convert; single-char Roman numerals (`I`, `V`, `X`…) convert only when preceded by a curated context word (`Schedule`, `Class`, `Phase`, `Title`, `Pope`, `King`, `Louis`, …) to protect the English pronoun "I"; a list-continuation pass then catches trailing bare Romans in the same clause (the "Schedule IV and V" case — seeded by the first two passes). The existing `Zeemish → Zee-mish` aliasing moved into the same module. `audio-producer.ts`'s `prepareForTTS` now ends with `normalizeForTTS(stripped)`. Regression harness at `agents/scripts/verify-normalize.mjs` (20 cases, runs via `pnpm verify-normalize` — same pattern as `verify-splice.mjs`).

2. **Conversion target: spelled-out words** (`Schedule IV` → `Schedule four`, not `Schedule 4`). Rationale: every TTS reads "four" as the cardinal; Arabic numerals like "Schedule 4" are read as "Schedule fourth" by some providers in ordinal contexts. Spelling the number out makes the fix provider-agnostic, which is the whole point of the module living upstream of the ElevenLabs-specific code. Character-count drift from the conversion is a few chars per beat (well under the 20k budget).

3. **Per-beat regen: new `Director.retryAudioBeat(pieceId, beatName)` method.** Deletes exactly one R2 object + one `daily_piece_audio` row, keeps `has_audio=1` so the other beats keep playing for readers, then calls `retryAudio(pieceId, force=true)` — producer's R2 head-check means only the deleted beat regenerates. Publisher's splice is a no-op when the rebuilt `audioBeats` map serialises identically to frontmatter (same beat names, same deterministic R2 paths). `retryAudio` gained a `force?: boolean` parameter (defaults `false`) so the 2026-04-22 has_audio=1 double-fire guard stays in place for UI-triggered Continue but is bypassable by per-beat regen.

4. **Admin UI always-visible retry.** Previously the whole retry block was gated `{!audioComplete && (...)}` — on `has_audio=1` operators saw zero controls. Now: per-beat "Regenerate" button on every audio row (confirm dialog warns about CDN cache → hard-refresh to hear new); Start-over button always visible when rows exist (confirm dialog warns about reader-visible downtime on published pieces); Continue button only when `!audioComplete` (it's a no-op once every beat exists). Small "Audio published ✓" chip in the section header when complete.

5. **Endpoint extended.** `/api/agents/audio-retry` (site worker) + `/audio-retry` (agents worker) both accept a new `mode=beat&beat=<kebab-name>` alongside the existing `continue`/`fresh` modes. Both also now accept `piece_id=<uuid>` as an alternative to `date` for unambiguous resolution at multi-per-day. Beat-name validated against `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/` on both sides (defense in depth — Director re-validates too).

**Trade-offs:**
- CDN caching: regenerated clips live at the same deterministic R2 key → same `public_url`. Browsers/Cloudflare may serve the stale clip until cache expires. Admin UI explicitly surfaces the hard-refresh requirement. Cache-header tuning on `/audio/*` is a separate project.
- Publisher splice is a no-op during per-beat regen (the `audioBeats` frontmatter map serialises identically). This is fine — the actual fresh MP3 is on R2 at the same URL. `has_audio` stays `1` throughout so no second commit is needed. But it means there's no git-history breadcrumb for "beat X regenerated at time T" — observer_events + pipeline_log carry that signal instead.
- Roman-numeral false positives: the regex is deliberately conservative. `IIII` (invalid Roman) is preserved unchanged (round-trip parse rejects it). `WWII` is preserved (no word boundary inside the token). `V-neck` is preserved (no number-word seed for pass 3). Trade-off: a bare `V` in prose without a context word won't convert — but that's the cost of protecting "I" as a pronoun, and the context-word list covers the realistic cases.
- `retryAudio(pieceId, force=true)` from `retryAudioBeat` bypasses the has_audio guard that was added as defense-in-depth for the 2026-04-17 corruption. Safe because the corruption cause (spliceAudioBeats regex bug in commit `55fce9f`) is separately fixed; the guard remains for UI-triggered Continue.

**Files:** NEW [agents/src/shared/tts-normalize.ts](../agents/src/shared/tts-normalize.ts), NEW [agents/scripts/verify-normalize.mjs](../agents/scripts/verify-normalize.mjs), EDIT [agents/src/audio-producer.ts](../agents/src/audio-producer.ts), EDIT [agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts), EDIT [agents/src/server.ts](../agents/src/server.ts), EDIT [agents/package.json](../agents/package.json), EDIT [src/pages/api/agents/audio-retry.ts](../src/pages/api/agents/audio-retry.ts), EDIT [src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro).

**Verification:** 20-case regression harness passes (`pnpm verify-normalize`), `verify-splice` regression still passes, agents typecheck clean aside from pre-existing server.ts SubAgent errors (one new instance of the same pattern on the new `retryAudioBeat` stub call — consistent with prior `retryAudio`/`retryAudioFresh` calls). Live verification: regenerate a beat on the 2026-04-23 cannabis piece (the trigger piece) after deploy and confirm "Schedule three/four/five" pronunciation.

## 2026-04-22: Admin polish — observer feed cap + pipeline history per-piece + word_count canonical

**Context:** Final three points from the FOLLOWUPS audit entry. Not bugs — policy/design calls that had been deferred as "needs your input." Taken together, they close the audit entry fully.

**Decisions + shipping:**

1. **Observer events feed LIMIT 30 → 100.** The admin home already surfaces `openEscalations` + `errorsThisWeek` as top-level stats — the feed below is the chronological log, not the anomaly view. Raising to 100 gives headroom without adding filter complexity. At current volume ~28 events (4 escalation + 20 info + 4 warn), 100 rows is ~3-4 weeks. At hypothetical 1h cadence with full producer+reflection+Zita+audio traffic, still ~10 hours. No toggle — the job is "what happened recently" and chronology serves that.

2. **Pipeline history per-piece grouping.** At multi-per-day, "run" = pipeline attempt for a piece, not calendar day. Previously grouped by run_id=date, picking the latest terminal step and hiding that the first piece may have failed while the second succeeded. New query: `LEFT JOIN daily_pieces ON dp.id = pl.piece_id` + correlated subquery keyed on `piece_id` (with null-fallback to run_id for any legacy null-piece_id rows). Each row shows the piece's date + headline + verdict; orphan runs (scanner skipped / pre-publish error) render with "(unpublished run)" label. `lifetimeRuns = COUNT(DISTINCT run_id)` stays day-keyed — a legitimate distinct-days-active stat — and wasn't renamed.

3. **word_count — Drafter's value is canonical, Director stops re-computing.** Drafter returns `wordCount = mdx.split(/\s+/).length` at draft time. Director was re-computing on post-splice MDX (frontmatter gained `voiceScore`, `pieceId`, `publishedAt`, ~6 extra tokens). Result: `drafting done` pipeline_log showed 1080, `daily_pieces.word_count` stored 1086. Admin page had to pick one. Fix: INSERT binds `wordCount` (the Drafter value) directly. One source of truth. Historical rows stay as-is — ~6-word drift is cosmetic and a backfill UPDATE is more risk than the fix is worth.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pipeline history query gains a LEFT JOIN + correlated subquery branch. D1 handles this cleanly (verified via build, no new typecheck errors on admin.astro). A piece_id-free legacy row still renders via the `OR (p2.piece_id IS NULL AND p1.piece_id IS NULL AND p2.run_id = p1.run_id)` fallback clause — no historical rows get dropped.
- 100-row observer feed has ~3x the payload of the old 30-row feed. Negligible — each row is small JSON. No perf concern.
- word_count drift is permanent on existing rows. Future operator reports would show post-Drafter count. Acceptable; no reader-facing surface uses it.

**Files:** [src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro), [agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts).

**Closes:** FOLLOWUPS audit entry — all 5 numbered points resolved; promoted to `[resolved]`.

## 2026-04-22: Removed 4 dead `/api/dashboard/*` endpoints

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS `[open] 2026-04-20: Audit sibling dashboard API endpoints for the same dead-code pattern`. The 2026-04-20 `today.ts` removal raised the question of whether its siblings (`analytics.ts`, `observer.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `recent.ts`, `stats.ts`) were similarly orphaned. Added to the list after the 2026-04-20 Memory panel work: `memory.ts`, which was created for that panel but the Astro page ended up querying D1 directly in frontmatter — born orphaned.

**Decision:** grep-audit, delete the dead, keep the live.

**Audit results** (grep across `src/` + `scripts/`, excluding self-references):
- `analytics.ts` — 0 callers. **Deleted.**
- `recent.ts` — 0 callers. **Deleted.**
- `stats.ts` — 0 callers. **Deleted.**
- `memory.ts` — 0 callers. **Deleted.** Born orphaned (DECISIONS 2026-04-20 specified it as the Memory panel's feed, but the page fetches from D1 directly in Astro frontmatter).
- `observer.ts` — 1 caller (`admin.astro` fetches `/api/dashboard/observer` for the acknowledge POST). **Kept.**
- `pipeline.ts` — 2 callers (`admin.astro` poller + `scripts/reset-today.sh` monitor). **Kept.**

**Trade-offs:**
- Public dashboard + library page already query D1 directly in Astro frontmatter — removing the endpoints doesn't affect behavior. The dashboard page actually BECAME more correct after memory.ts was removed from the design: the original Build-1 plan used the endpoint, but the final implementation consolidated into frontmatter queries to keep all page-render data in one place.
- No external API consumers exist. No breaking change to worry about.
- Future public JSON surface decision deferred: `observer.ts` + `pipeline.ts` remain as the only public-ish dashboard endpoints and have clear consumers. If we ever need a public API, we'd add specific endpoints with clear SLA rather than repopulating the speculative surface.

**Doc updates:** `docs/RUNBOOK.md` "Dashboard API endpoints" collapsed to the two survivors + note that public dashboard queries D1 directly. `docs/AGENTS.md` Learner-reader-surfaces rewritten to reference direct queries. `docs/CLAUDE.md` Memory-panel description updated. `docs/FOLLOWUPS.md` closes the audit entry + the admin all-pieces slug spot-check (verified 7/7 production pieces resolve via `/daily/{date}/{slug}/` with 200).

**Files removed:** `src/pages/api/dashboard/analytics.ts`, `recent.ts`, `stats.ts`, `memory.ts`.

## 2026-04-22: 12-min watchdog alarm for silent audio stalls (Phase E3 of audio trio fix)

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS `[open] 2026-04-19: Audio pipeline silent stall between alarm chunks`. 2026-04-17 retry attempt stopped at 4/8 beats with no observer event and no log entry. Root cause analysis: ElevenLabs per-attempt timeout is 90s × up to 3 attempts + backoffs ≈ 273s worst case per beat. A piece with 6-8 long beats can exceed the 15-min alarm wall-clock budget mid-call. Cloudflare terminates the invocation; nothing throws in the `runAudioPipeline` try/catch paths; no observer event fires. Result: piece stays in partial state (has_audio=0, some beat rows in daily_piece_audio) with no signal to the admin.

**Decision:** watchdog alarm scheduled at the top of `runAudioPipelineScheduled`. 12-min delay gives the outer alarm 3-min headroom so the watchdog fires while or just after the outer alarm terminates — a true silent stall is visible within ~12-15 min of arming.

**What shipped:**
- `runAudioPipelineScheduled` → `this.schedule(12 * 60, 'checkAudioStalled', {pieceId, date, title, armedAt: Date.now()})` — scheduled BEFORE the pipeline runs so even early abort paths are covered.
- New method `checkAudioStalled(payload)`:
  1. `SELECT has_audio FROM daily_pieces WHERE id = ?` — if 1, no-op (happy path, pipeline completed normally).
  2. `SELECT id FROM observer_events WHERE piece_id = ? AND title LIKE 'Audio failure:%' AND created_at >= armedAt` — if present, no-op (Producer/Auditor/Publisher failure already surfaced).
  3. Otherwise: `observer.logAudioFailure(phase='producer', reason='Silent stall — audio pipeline exceeded 12min watchdog...')`. Escalation severity surfaces in admin feed.
- `observer_events.piece_id` scoping (migration 0020) gives the failure lookup clean isolation — same-date other pieces don't false-trigger this piece's watchdog.

**Trade-offs:**
- Happy path cost: one no-op alarm fire (SQLite reads only, no Claude/ElevenLabs/GitHub) per audio pipeline invocation. Cheap.
- The watchdog fires 12 min after `runAudioPipelineScheduled` schedules itself, not after it actually starts. In practice the 1-second delay before the scheduled run is fired is negligible — the 3-min headroom handles it.
- If a pipeline legitimately takes >12 min (unlikely with current beat counts), the watchdog will false-fire. At that point the escalation would read wrong, but the pipeline would still complete normally and land `has_audio=1`. Worst case is one mis-labeled warn event. Accepted — raising the threshold to 15 min would defeat the point.
- Reusing `logAudioFailure` rather than adding `logAudioStalled` keeps the Observer surface lean. The reason string is self-explanatory; operators can grep for "Silent stall" if they want to filter.
- No retry automation — watchdog surfaces the stall; operator decides whether to Continue or Start over from the admin dashboard. Matches the ship-and-retry posture already in place.

## 2026-04-22: retryAudio short-circuits when audio already complete (Phase E2 of audio trio fix)

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS `[open] 2026-04-19: Continue retry path may trigger full re-run`. `retryAudio` at [`agents/src/director.ts:830`](../agents/src/director.ts) validated the pieceId, read the piece's date + headline, and scheduled `runAudioPipelineScheduled` — **with no check for `has_audio=1`**. A completed piece retried via "Continue" ran the full pipeline: Producer no-op'd via R2 head-check, but Auditor and Publisher both ran. Stacked with the Phase E1 regex bug this produced the 2026-04-17 corruption.

**Decision:** short-circuit at the top of `retryAudio` when `has_audio === 1`. Log via `observer.logError` (warn severity) with the message `retryAudio no-op: piece X already has audio published. Use "Start over" to regenerate.` Return cleanly without scheduling an alarm. Operator sees the no-op in the admin observer feed.

**Trade-offs:**
- Short-circuit is in `retryAudio`, not `retryAudioFresh`. "Start over" is explicit regenerate-and-replace — it wipes `has_audio=0` first so its own inner `retryAudio` call passes the guard. The split matches the admin UI's "Continue" vs "Start over" buttons semantically.
- Defense-in-depth with Phase E1. Even a simultaneous race that dispatches two retries will see one of them land `has_audio=1` first and the other short-circuit. Without the guard, both would run; without E1, the second would corrupt; with E1 alone, the second produces a redundant no-op commit. E1 + E2 gives the cleanest behaviour.
- The observer event uses `logError` (severity: warn) rather than a new dedicated helper. Keeps the Observer surface lean — the message is self-explanatory.

**Files:** [agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts).

## 2026-04-22: spliceAudioBeats regex consumed leading newline — root cause of 2026-04-17 frontmatter corruption

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS `[open] 2026-04-19: Publisher.publishAudio double-fires on Continue retry path` — 2026-04-17 retro audio produced two commits, the second collapsing `qualityFlag: "low"\n---\n` to `qualityFlag: "low"---` (no YAML terminator, broke content-collection parsing). Required a `git revert` to recover. FOLLOWUPS entry named two hypothetical bugs stacked: (1) Continue re-runs full pipeline, (2) publisher's idempotent guard should have caught the second commit but didn't. Entry said the corruption state "the regex logic on paper should not be able to generate."

**Root cause (2026-04-22 investigation):** the regex CAN generate the corruption state. [`spliceAudioBeats`](../agents/src/publisher.ts) at line 234:
```ts
const withoutExisting = mdx.replace(/\naudioBeats:\n(?:  .+\n)*/, '');
```
consumes the `\n` BEFORE `audioBeats:`. Input `qualityFlag: "low"\naudioBeats:\n  beat-1: "url"\n---\n` becomes `qualityFlag: "low"---\n` — newline lost. The splice regex `/^(---\n[\s\S]*?)(\n---\n)/` then can't find `\n---\n` (there's no newline before `---` anymore), becomes a no-op, and returns `withoutExisting` unchanged. `updatedMdx === withoutExisting ≠ current.mdx`, so `publishAudio`'s idempotent guard at `publisher.ts:103` (`updatedMdx === current.mdx`) fails to fire. Publisher commits the stripped-but-not-respliced file. Verified via node-level reproducer.

**Fix:** capture the leading newline in group 1 and restore it:
```ts
const withoutExisting = mdx.replace(/(\n)audioBeats:\n(?:  .+\n)*/, '$1');
```
Input `qualityFlag: "low"\naudioBeats:\n...\n---\n` now strips to `qualityFlag: "low"\n---\n` (newline preserved). Splice regex matches `\n---\n`, splice inserts the block, idempotent guard fires on identical audioBeats maps.

**Regression test:** [`agents/scripts/verify-splice.mjs`](../agents/scripts/verify-splice.mjs) — 4 cases covering (1) fresh MDX adds block, (2) idempotent re-splice with identical map, (3) re-splice with different map preserves frontmatter terminator (the 2026-04-17 corruption case), (4) audioBeats followed by another frontmatter key — strip removes only audioBeats, keeps sibling. Runs as `pnpm verify-splice` in the `agents/` workspace. Node-level pure string transformation — no worker setup needed.

**Trade-offs:**
- Case 4 surfaces an existing behavior: re-splice moves the audioBeats block to end-of-frontmatter (splice regex always inserts before closing `---`). The content schema doesn't care about frontmatter key order, so this is a non-regression. Documented in the test comment.
- The fix is in the pure regex transformation — no MDX parser dependency, no runtime semantics change beyond the bug. Existing good commits stay as-is (no re-publish required).
- Continue button double-fire is a separate concern — Phase E2 short-circuits `retryAudio` when `has_audio=1`. But even without E2, E1 alone means a double-click now produces two IDENTICAL commits (no-op second) instead of one correct + one corrupted.

## 2026-04-22: Admin Zita grouped by piece_id (Phase D of multi-per-day audit)

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS audit entry point #2. `zita_messages` has had a `piece_id` column since migration 0014 (Phase 1 of multi-per-day cadence work) but the admin Zita page (`/dashboard/admin/zita/`) never consumed it — conversations were grouped by `(user_id, piece_date)`, pooling at multi-per-day, and headlines were looked up via `daily_pieces WHERE date IN (...)` which overwrites in the title Map when multiple pieces share a date.

**Decision:** switch the admin Zita page to piece_id grouping + piece_id-keyed headline lookup.

**What shipped:**
- `Conversation` + `Message` types gain `piece_id: string | null`.
- `SELECT` changes from `GROUP BY user_id, piece_date` to `GROUP BY user_id, piece_id`. `MAX(piece_date)` included in SELECT for display compat (the banner label still shows piece_date when headline lookup fails).
- Headlines Map rekeyed: `pieceTitles: Map<piece_id, headline>`. Title SELECT switches from `daily_pieces WHERE date IN (...)` to `WHERE id IN (...)` — no more last-writer-wins at multi-per-day.
- Render loop `key = ${user_id}|${piece_id ?? piece_date}` with piece_date fallback for any legacy NULL-piece_id row. Headline resolution prefers piece_id; falls back to piece_date label (plain date) when piece_id is null or headline lookup misses.
- `messagesByKey` grouping Map rekeyed the same way.

**Trade-offs:**
- Legacy rows with NULL piece_id would render under the piece_date fallback key, sharing with other NULL-piece_id rows. 0014 backfill + 0013 Commit A's hand-map populated piece_id for all 92 historical rows, so null-piece_id doesn't exist in production zita_messages today. The fallback is defensive.
- Per-piece admin page's "Questions from readers" section at [src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro:244](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/%5Bdate%5D/%5Bslug%5D.astro) was already piece_id-scoped (shipped with the Phase 7 nested route in commit `3208c86`) — verified, no change needed.
- Non-daily (lessons-era) rows have piece_date=NULL and piece_id=NULL. They render as "Non-daily (lessons)" with no deep-link, same as before.

**Verify after deploy:** at multi-per-day a reader chatting with both same-date pieces should produce two distinct conversation cards (one per piece), each with its correct headline. At current traffic (3 readers across 7 pieces) the effect is near-zero today — visible regression tester would need to simulate a same-day multi-piece chat.

## 2026-04-22: Admin + dashboard run log scoped by piece_id (Phase C of multi-per-day audit)

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS audit entry point #3 + residual `WHERE date = ?` entry. After migration 0019 backfilled `piece_id` on `audit_results` + `daily_candidates`, two consumer sites were still keying off `task_id = 'daily/${date}'` and `WHERE date IN (...)`: admin home's "All Pieces" rounds/candidates widget and the public dashboard's week-pieces run log. At multi-per-day today's two pieces each showed the same pooled counts (e.g. both tobacco and air-traffic would display `2 rounds, 50 candidates` from their combined dataset). Separately, the public dashboard's today's-piece hero still did `WHERE date = ? LIMIT 1` — arbitrary same-date pick.

**Decision:** swap both consumer sites to `piece_id IN (...)` joins using `daily_pieces.id`; add `ORDER BY date DESC, published_at DESC` tiebreakers to the parent SELECTs so same-date pieces stay in publish order; fix the dashboard hero with `ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 1` (matches the homepage + daily-index pattern already shipped in Phase 4 of the morning's schema fix).

**What shipped:**
- **`src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro`** — `Piece` type gains `id`. pieces SELECT adds `id` column + `ORDER BY date DESC, published_at DESC`. `roundsByDate`/`candsByDate` renamed to `roundsByPiece`/`candsByPiece`; both queries now `WHERE piece_id IN (...) GROUP BY piece_id`. `allPieces` map uses `p.id` for lookups.
- **`src/pages/dashboard/index.astro`** — `Piece` type gains `id`. Today's piece hero SELECT adds `id` + `ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 1`. Week pieces SELECT adds `id` + `ORDER BY date DESC, published_at DESC`. Rounds/candidates maps + queries re-keyed on piece_id.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pre-Phase-C pre-0018 rows have NULL `piece_id` on audit_results (9 rows backfilled in 0019; all filled). So all production rows now have piece_id and the queries return the same totals as the pre-fix date-keyed versions at 1/day cadence — no behavioral regression there.
- Local D1 (dev) doesn't have the 0014–0019 backfills unless the developer applies them manually — the dashboard renders empty in local dev. Production (where backfills ran) is the authoritative test surface. Unit-level testing wasn't added because the queries are simple SQL and the schema guarantees are in the migration.
- Day-aggregation views unchanged: `lifetimeRuns = COUNT(DISTINCT run_id)` (distinct *days*), pipeline history grouped by run_id, weekCount by date — all intentionally day-level. `avgRoundsWeek` derives from the now-piece-scoped roundsByPiece map so its average is per-piece, not per-day (correct at multi-per-day).

**Verify in production after deploy:**
1. Admin home All Pieces list — today's two pieces (tobacco + air-traffic) should show distinct `rounds` + `candidates` counts.
2. Public dashboard today's piece hero — should display the most-recently-published same-date piece (currently air-traffic since it shipped later than tobacco today). Changes when next slot publishes.
3. Public dashboard run log — today's two pieces should show distinct counts.

## 2026-04-22: observer_events.piece_id column for per-piece admin scoping

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS `[open] 2026-04-22: Admin / dashboard / public pages — full multi-per-day audit` — user noticed on evening of 2026-04-22 that the per-piece admin deep-dive was still pooling observer events across both same-date pieces (tobacco piece page showed air-traffic's `Published`, `Reflection`, `Audio failure`, `Audio published` events mixed in — 9 events total when the piece only generated ~3 of them). The 2026-04-22 morning piece_id schema fix had fixed pipeline_log / audit_results / daily_candidates pooling but left observer_events untouched because it had no piece_id column and was known-intentional by the schema-fix design (kept as 36h day window).

**Decision:** Path 1 from the audit entry — add `piece_id` column to `observer_events` and thread through every agents-side call site. Follows the same schema-over-bandaid posture the user pushed for during the main piece_id schema fix session earlier today. The alternative (client-side substring match on title) would be brittle against title format drift and wouldn't capture all piece-scoped events.

**What shipped:**
1. **Migration 0020** — nullable `piece_id TEXT` + `idx_observer_events_piece`. Additive, no snapshot, no backfill. Historical rows stay NULL and surface via the 36h fallback on per-piece admin.
2. **`agents/src/observer.ts`** — 13 piece-scoped helpers gained a trailing optional `pieceId: string | null = null`. `writeEvent` INSERT extended to bind piece_id. `logDailyRunSkipped` binds the *existing* piece_id (the piece already in the slot), not a new one.
3. **`agents/src/director.ts`** — threaded pieceId through all 13 observer call sites in director.ts. pieceId is pre-allocated at the top of `triggerDailyPiece()` per Phase 3 of this morning's schema fix, so it's in scope everywhere.
4. **`src/lib/observer-events.ts`** — `ObserverEventInput` gained optional `pieceId`. INSERT binding extended. 4 call sites in site-worker (`/api/zita/chat`, `/api/dashboard/admin/settings`) unchanged for now — none currently receive piece_id in their request context. That's a separate future task (zita-chat component would need a `data-piece-id` attribute, chat endpoint would need to accept & scope by it, zita_messages writes would need piece_id populated — all cross-cutting). Deferred explicitly.
5. **`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro`** — observer_events query now:
   ```sql
   WHERE piece_id = ?
      OR (piece_id IS NULL AND created_at >= ? AND created_at < ?)
   ```
   Mixed mode: new piece-scoped events bind directly; legacy NULL rows keep the 36h day window fallback so admin sees them somewhere rather than losing them.

**Trade-offs:**
- Legacy rows (pre-0020) stay NULL permanently. Backfilling would mean parsing title/body text for headline matches — the same kind of brittle substring work the schema fix was meant to replace. Not worth it for a finite set of historical rows that age out.
- Site-worker `logObserverEvent` callers stay pieceId-null for now. At today's traffic (4 observer writes/day from site worker, all Zita-related) the admin feed won't show meaningful degradation. When zita-chat grows real traffic + multi-per-day cadence overlap, circle back.
- `logDailyRunSkipped` uses the *existing* (already-published) piece's id rather than a new one. Correct semantically — the skip event belongs to the piece that's blocking the slot.
- Mixed piece_id + 36h fallback in the admin query is intentional. Pure piece_id scope would lose system events (admin_settings_changed, zita_rate_limited) from per-piece view; pure 36h window was the problem we started with. Keep both.

**Verify after next publish:** new `Published`, `Reflection`, `Audio published` rows should have piece_id = the piece's UUID. Per-piece admin renders only that piece's new events + any legacy/system events caught in the 36h window — no more cross-piece pooling of same-date events.

## 2026-04-22: Curator prompt exposes candidate UUIDs so `selected` can flip

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS `[open] 2026-04-21: daily_candidates.selected never flipped on historical runs` — prod had 250 candidate rows across 5 dates, zero with `selected = 1`. Director's post-curation UPDATE at [director.ts:227](../agents/src/director.ts) was wrapped in `.run().catch(() => {})`, so whatever was going wrong was silent. Admin per-piece deep-dive's "picked candidate marked with teal dot" has therefore never rendered.

**Root cause:** [buildCuratorPrompt](../agents/src/curator-prompt.ts) rendered candidates as `${i+1}. [${category}] "${headline}" (${source})` — **no UUID in the prompt at all**. Claude's returned `selectedCandidateId` was whatever it guessed (empty, a number, a made-up string) — never a real row id. The UPDATE then matched 0 rows. `.catch(() => {})` hid the 0-rows outcome (0 rows isn't an exception — `.run()` succeeds; the silent-catch caught only throw-path errors). Two failure modes stacked, producing zero signal.

**Fix:**
1. **Prompt fix** — `buildCuratorPrompt` now emits `${i+1}. id: ${c.id}\n   [${category}] "${headline}" (${source})\n   ${summary}`. Added explicit instruction: "selectedCandidateId MUST be the exact id string shown next to the chosen candidate above — do not invent, truncate, or guess."
2. **Silent-catch removal** — the UPDATE is now wrapped in try/catch that inspects `upd.meta.changes`. Three branches fire `observer.logError` on regression: (a) throw during UPDATE, (b) UPDATE runs but 0 rows match (id-shape drift), (c) curator returned no `selectedCandidateId` at all. Next regression in this code path is visible in the admin observer feed instead of silent.

**Trade-offs:**
- Historical 250 rows of `selected=0` stay as-is — the winning id for those runs is not recoverable (Curator's reasoning wasn't persisted and the admin feed wasn't surfacing Curator's raw output). Backfilling would mean guessing, which is the class of bug we just fixed.
- The prompt is ~50 chars longer per candidate × 50 candidates = ~2500 extra input tokens per curate call. Negligible vs the ~1200 output tokens we already pay Claude.
- Observability adds up to 3 new observer_events per run (one per regression branch). At happy path, zero new events.
- Didn't change the response schema (still `selectedCandidateId` at the top level) — no downstream consumers to update.

**Verify on next 02:00 UTC run:** `SELECT id, selected FROM daily_candidates WHERE piece_id = '<new-piece-id>' AND selected = 1` should return exactly 1 row. Per-piece admin page's teal dot should render on the Curator section for the first time.

**Files:** [agents/src/curator-prompt.ts](../agents/src/curator-prompt.ts), [agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts). No migration; code-only.

## 2026-04-22: piece_id columns on day-keyed tables (audit_results / pipeline_log / daily_candidates)

**Context:** Supersedes the earlier 2026-04-22 entry "Time-window scoping for admin per-piece deep-dive at multi-per-day" below. That entry shipped a midpoint-between-publishes bandaid on the astro-side admin page to isolate per-piece data without a schema change. User pushed back ("you are going round and round") — the bandaid was correct-for-now but the root cause was schema-level: three tables had no `piece_id` column. This entry is the proper fix, shipped across 5 phases with pauses between each.

**The bug (recap):** at `interval_hours < 24`, two pieces publishing on the same date shared the same `audit_results.task_id = 'daily/<date>'`, `pipeline_log.run_id = '<date>'`, and `daily_candidates.date = '<date>'`. The admin per-piece deep-dive page pooled both pieces' rows. Worse, [`director.ts:950`](../agents/src/director.ts:950) built identical `draft_id = 'daily/<date>-r<N>'` for both pieces' round 1, so group-by-draft_id collided the two pieces with D1's last-writer-wins, surfacing air-traffic's facts on the tobacco admin page (screenshot evidence).

**Decision:** add nullable `piece_id TEXT` to all three tables. Director pre-allocates `pieceId` at the top of `triggerDailyPiece()` (not publish-time, as before) so every logStep / saveAuditResults / scanner candidate INSERT carries it from the first write. Readers scope by `WHERE piece_id = ?` for unambiguous multi-per-day isolation. `run_id` stays `YYYY-MM-DD` permanently (Phase 3 walk-back from 2026-04-21 preserved) — `piece_id` is additive, not a replacement, so day-aggregation consumers keep working.

**Phase log (5 phases, 4 pauses, plan at `~/.claude/plans/glowing-snacking-shell.md`):**

| Phase | What shipped | Migration | Verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `migrations/0018_pipeline_log_piece_id.sql` — ALTER + index. Scoped DOWN from the original plan after `PRAGMA` revealed 0014 had already added the column to `audit_results` + `daily_candidates` | 0018 | `PRAGMA table_info(pipeline_log)` shows column |
| 2 | `migrations/0019_piece_id_backfill.sql` — 9 UPDATEs covering 9 + 153 + 350 = 512 null rows. Two strategies: pre-2026-04-22 joined on date (unambiguous at 1/day); 2026-04-22 split by midpoint (1776850364493) between the two pieces' published_at | 0019 (manual) | `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE piece_id IS NULL` returns 0 across all three tables |
| 3 | Agents worker writer threading. Moved `const pieceId = crypto.randomUUID()` from line 322 (mid-publish) to top of `triggerDailyPiece()`. `logStep()` + `saveAuditResults()` + `scanner.scan()` + `learner.analysePiecePostPublish()` all thread piece_id. retryAudio's publish-step lookup gains `AND piece_id = ?`. Removed `LEARNER_PIPELINE_LOOKBACK_MS` / `LOOKAHEAD_MS` — no longer needed | — | typecheck clean on touched files (18 pre-existing `server.ts` SubAgent errors unchanged) |
| 4 | Site worker reader repointing. Three queries on `[date]/[slug].astro` switch to `WHERE piece_id = ?`. Midpoint bandaid deleted. `/api/daily/[date]/made.ts` 5 queries prefer piece_id. `made-by.ts` `loadMadeTeaser` takes optional pieceId. `/api/dashboard/pipeline.ts` returns `groups[]` + `headlines{}` keyed by piece_id. `admin.astro` renders today's run as collapsible per-piece `<details>` blocks — closes Bug A (flat 26-step blob) | — | `pnpm build` clean, preview API returns new shape |
| 5 | This DECISIONS entry + FOLLOWUPS closes + CLAUDE.md section | — | docs committed alongside code per feedback rule |

**Writer-side topology after Phase 3:**

```ts
// director.ts
async triggerDailyPiece(force = false): Promise<...> {
  const pieceId = crypto.randomUUID();        // pre-allocated at run-start
  // ... slot guard, interval read ...
  await this.logStep(today, pieceId, 'scanning', 'running', { intervalHours });
  const candidates = await scanner.scan(pieceId);
  // ... curator, drafter, auditors (saveAuditResults takes pieceId) ...
  // daily_pieces INSERT uses the SAME pieceId (no fresh UUID)
}

private async logStep(runId, pieceId, step, status, data) {
  INSERT INTO pipeline_log (..., piece_id) VALUES (..., ?);
}

private async saveAuditResults(taskId, pieceId, round, voice, structure, facts) {
  INSERT INTO audit_results (..., piece_id) VALUES (..., ?);  // x3 batched
}
```

Orphan piece_ids (runs that skip or error before publish) have rows in pipeline_log / audit_results / daily_candidates with a piece_id that never becomes `daily_pieces.id`. Accepted — those rows don't render on any piece's admin page (no daily_pieces row to JOIN on) but stay visible on day-aggregation views via `run_id`.

**Trade-offs considered:**

1. **Why pre-allocate at run-start vs publish-time?** — so every earlier write carries piece_id. Alternative: two-pass — write with NULL, back-fill at publish. More complex, introduces a window where readers might see half-populated rows, and orphan rows (scanner-skipped runs) would have no piece_id to group by. Pre-allocation is cleaner.

2. **Why keep `run_id = YYYY-MM-DD`?** — the 2026-04-21 walk-back lesson. Four site-worker consumers embedded date assumptions; changing run_id broke them. Adding piece_id alongside preserves the day-grouping views (admin pipeline history, lifetime runs) while enabling per-piece isolation.

3. **Why fall back to date-keyed queries when pieceId is null?** — defensive. Post-Phase-7 every MDX has pieceId in frontmatter, but a stale cached reader bundle or a typo'd URL might still hit the page without one. Empty result would be more confusing than the day-view fallback.

4. **Why not delete the superseded DECISIONS entry?** — append-only rule. The bandaid is part of the session's history and the mid-session course-correction is valuable context for future operators.

**Verified end-to-end against production D1 (2026-04-22):**
- `audit_results`: air-traffic 6 rows (r1+r2 × 3 auditors), tobacco 3 rows (r1 × 3 auditors), 0 NULL.
- `pipeline_log`: air-traffic 23 rows including the 04:19 audio retry, tobacco 19 rows, 0 NULL.
- `daily_candidates`: 50 / 50 per piece, 0 NULL.
- All three new queries `WHERE piece_id = ?` return the expected row counts via `wrangler d1 execute --remote`.

**Rollback:**
- Full session: `git reset --hard 8902df9`.
- Phase 1 migration: `ALTER TABLE pipeline_log DROP COLUMN piece_id` (D1 supports DROP COLUMN as of 2024).
- Phase 2 backfill: `UPDATE <table> SET piece_id = NULL`; readers keep a date-keyed fallback so partial NULL coverage doesn't crash.
- Phase 3 + 4: `git revert <sha>` per phase.

**Post-ship verification (pending deploy):**
- Hit `https://zeemish.io/dashboard/admin/piece/2026-04-22/uk-bill-bans-.../` → AUDIT ROUNDS (1), voice 92/100, tobacco facts only, 50 candidates.
- Hit `https://zeemish.io/dashboard/admin/piece/2026-04-22/12-5-billion-.../` → AUDIT ROUNDS (2), voice 95/100, COBOL/NATS facts, 50 candidates.
- Hit `https://zeemish.io/dashboard/admin/` → Today's Run shows two collapsible per-piece blocks.

## 2026-04-22: Time-window scoping for admin per-piece deep-dive at multi-per-day

**Context:** User flipped `interval_hours=12` overnight; 2026-04-22 shipped two pieces (air-traffic at 02:00 UTC, tobacco at 14:00 UTC after the slot-aware-guard fix). Visiting `/dashboard/admin/piece/2026-04-22/uk-bill-bans-.../` showed the tobacco piece header but air-traffic's audit rounds: Round 2 (final) with voice note "Close adds extra sentence" and fact claims about $12.5 billion / NATS / COBOL. Scanner candidates count showed 100 (two runs pooled). Operator can't trust the page.

**Root cause:** three queries on [`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/%5Bdate%5D/%5Bslug%5D.astro) scope by date, not piece_id — `audit_results.task_id = 'daily/<date>'`, `pipeline_log.run_id = '<date>'`, `daily_candidates.date = '<date>'`. None of those tables has a piece_id column. Worse, [`director.ts:950`](../agents/src/director.ts:950) builds `draft_id = 'daily/<date>-r<N>'` — both same-date pieces have identical draft_ids at round 1, so the page's group-by-draft_id collides the two pieces' rows with D1's last-writer-wins.

The file's own pre-fix comment (lines 117-120) called this "intentional — show the day's activity, matching the Phase 3 walk-back". That reasoning breaks at multi-per-day: the page header names one piece, the body shows another. Not a day view, a misattribution.

**Decision:** time-window scope the 3 day-keyed queries at query time. No schema change. No agent/migration work. Pure astro-site worker fix, reverts cleanly.

```ts
const sameDayPieces = /* SELECT id, published_at FROM daily_pieces WHERE date = ? ORDER BY published_at ASC */;
const thisIdx = pieceId ? sameDayPieces.findIndex((p) => p.id === pieceId) : -1;
const isMultiPerDay = sameDayPieces.length > 1 && thisIdx >= 0 && piece?.published_at != null;
// Midpoint between consecutive pieces' published_at values partitions
// the day into non-overlapping intervals. Self-scaling: tighter windows
// at short intervals, wider windows (absorbing audio retries) at long.
const prevMid = isMultiPerDay && thisIdx > 0
  ? Math.floor((sameDayPieces[thisIdx - 1].published_at + piece.published_at) / 2) : null;
const nextMid = isMultiPerDay && thisIdx < sameDayPieces.length - 1
  ? Math.floor((piece.published_at + sameDayPieces[thisIdx + 1].published_at) / 2) : null;
const windowStart = prevMid ?? 0;
const windowEnd = nextMid ?? Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
```

Then `audit_results / pipeline_log / daily_candidates` all gain `AND created_at >= ? AND created_at < ?` bound on `(windowStart, windowEnd)`. observer_events keeps its 36h window (legitimate day view of operator events). Audio + Zita sections already piece-scoped via `piece_id` — unchanged.

**False start corrected mid-session:** first pass used a fixed 30min post-publish buffer (`windowStart = prev.published_at + 30min`, `windowEnd = this.published_at + 30min`). User pushed back asking for deep verification against real data. Running the queries via `wrangler d1 execute --remote` against 2026-04-22 rows turned up an air-traffic audio retry at 04:19:14 UTC — **37min after its publish at 03:42:38**, outside the 30min buffer. Those retry rows would have leaked into tobacco's window. Switched to midpoint partitioning: midpoint between air-traffic (03:42:38) and tobacco (18:42:50) is 11:12 UTC, so air-traffic's window is [0, 11:12) and comfortably contains retries up to half the inter-publish gap.

**Verified against real D1 data for 2026-04-22 (both pieces):**
- `audit_results` — air-traffic window returns 6 rows (r1+r2 × 3 auditors); tobacco returns 3 rows (r1 × 3 auditors). Zero crossover.
- `pipeline_log` — air-traffic window returns 23 rows including the 04:19 audio retry; tobacco returns 18 rows. Zero crossover.
- `daily_candidates` — 50 per piece (two scanner runs). Zero crossover.

**Trade-offs considered:**

1. **Why not `audit_results.piece_id` column?** — correct long-term fix, but requires: migration + backfill, director allocates piece_id at run-start (not publish-time, which is Phase 1's pattern), threading it through every `saveAuditResults` + `logStep` + `daily_candidates` INSERT, and parallel code changes across the agents worker. Wants its own plan doc with pause points. Filed in FOLLOWUPS. Time-window scope unblocks the operator today.

2. **Why `published_at` midpoints instead of scanner-start timestamps?** — scanner-start partitioning would be perfect (actual run boundaries), but requires joining on pipeline_log to find each piece's first `scanning running` row and trusting the sort order matches publish order. Midpoint gives a clean formula on a single `daily_pieces` query and absorbs audio retries up to half the gap — at interval_hours=1 (minimum) that's 30min, which matches the fixed-buffer approach at its tightest. At interval_hours=12 it stretches to ~6h.

3. **Why midpoint and not fixed post-publish buffer?** — verified-against-data call. Real 2026-04-22 run had a 37min audio retry outside a 30min buffer. Bumping the buffer to 60min or 90min is arbitrary and still breaks on heavier retries. Midpoint self-scales to the gap between runs.

4. **At `interval_hours=24`, any change?** — no. `sameDayPieces.length === 1`, `isMultiPerDay === false`, both midpoints return null → `windowStart=0`, `windowEnd=MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Queries functionally identical to pre-fix. All historical pieces unaffected.

5. **What about `admin.astro` (the Today's Run panel on the admin home)?** — shows all same-day pipeline rows in one flat stream. Cosmetic, data is correct, operator can read it. Deferred to FOLLOWUPS for a collapsible two-run UI.

**Residual edge case:** at multi-per-day a manual audio retry fired *later than half the inter-publish gap* would attribute to the wrong piece on the timeline section. The Audio section on the page reads `daily_piece_audio` directly (piece-scoped via migration 0015) so audio state is always correct — only the pipeline timeline loses the retry row. Documented, accepted.

**Verified:** build clean. Query math validated against production D1 row-by-row via `wrangler d1 execute --remote` (row counts and content match expected partitions for both pieces). Browser verification of the rendered admin page requires session cookies that aren't available in dev preview — relying on the query verification as proof of correctness.

**Not scoped:** Bug A (Today's Run flat list), proper piece_id columns on audit_results/pipeline_log/daily_candidates, Director piece_id-at-run-start refactor, admin home pipeline-history per-piece grouping. All filed in FOLLOWUPS.

## 2026-04-22: Slot-aware guard for multi-per-day cadence

**Context:** User flipped `admin_settings.interval_hours=12` evening of 2026-04-21. The 02:00 UTC run on 2026-04-22 fired and published the ATC piece as expected. The 14:00 UTC slot should have produced a second piece — nothing appeared, no pipeline_log entry, no observer event. User asked "why didn't 2pm run, check the issue, don't guess".

**Investigation:**
- Live pipeline API confirmed `intervalHours:12` recorded in the 02:00 UTC scanning step — the admin setting was read correctly.
- Last pipeline_log entry: `audio-publishing done` at T=1776826830410 (~03:40 UTC). Nothing at or after 14:00 UTC.
- Phase 3 gate math for `interval_hours=12`: `(14 - 2 + 24) % 12 === 0` → PASSES. So `dailyRun` WAS invoked at 14:00 UTC; the hourly cron fired.
- Silent-null path traced: [agents/src/director.ts:140-146](../agents/src/director.ts:140) `if (existing) return null` after `SELECT id FROM daily_pieces WHERE date = ? LIMIT 1` — bailed *before* writing the first `scanning` logStep, hence the zero trace.
- Phase 1 through Phase 7's multi-per-day correctness audits never touched this guard. The CLAUDE.md claim "all multi-per-day correctness blockers resolved as of `cbf1f17`" was factually wrong.

**Decision:** replace the calendar-day guard with a slot-window guard, and make the skip-path loud.

**Slot-window guard (Change 1):**

```ts
if (!force) {
  const now = new Date();
  const slotStartMs = Date.UTC(
    now.getUTCFullYear(), now.getUTCMonth(), now.getUTCDate(),
    now.getUTCHours(), 0, 0, 0,
  );
  const existing = await this.env.DB
    .prepare('SELECT id FROM daily_pieces WHERE published_at >= ? LIMIT 1')
    .bind(slotStartMs)
    .first<{ id: string }>();
  if (existing) {
    const observer = await this.subAgent(ObserverAgent, 'observer');
    await observer.logDailyRunSkipped(today, intervalHours, slotStartMs, existing.id);
    return null;
  }
}
```

Slot-start = top of the current UTC hour. Correct for any `interval_hours` value in `ALLOWED_INTERVAL_HOURS` because Phase 3's gate `(hour - 2 + 24) % intervalHours === 0` already rejected every non-slot-boundary hour before we reach `triggerDailyPiece`. At `interval_hours=24` slotStart rounds to 02:00 UTC and the guard's semantic matches the prior calendar-day behaviour for all practical purposes — no regression at current prod default.

**Observer-on-skip (Change 2):** new `logDailyRunSkipped(date, intervalHours, slotStartMs, existingPieceId)` helper in observer.ts. Severity `info` — this is expected protective behaviour when a slot re-dispatches (SDK quirk, manual replay, clock drift). Visible in the admin observer feed. Replaces the prior silent `return null`. Going forward "where did that run go?" has an answer.

**Why not remove the guard entirely:** defence-in-depth against double-publish within a single slot. If the Agents SDK cron ever double-dispatches (dedupe bug, manual re-registration, clock drift), the slot-window check catches it. Keeping the guard is cheap; losing the protection would be asymmetric risk.

**Why not conditional guard `if (intervalHours >= 24) { /* old */ }`:** works but semantically wrong — it says "below 24h cadence, no same-slot protection at all." The slot-window guard is the right abstraction at every cadence.

**Why `published_at` as the filter column (not `created_at`):** `published_at` is set to the same `Date.now()` value that flows into the MDX frontmatter at publish time. It's the authoritative "this slot's piece landed" timestamp. `created_at` on `daily_pieces` happens to be set to the same value today, but semantically `published_at` matches intent.

**Why not add an index on `published_at`:** `daily_pieces` has 6 rows. Table scan is instant. Revisit if/when volume crosses ~10k.

**Rollback point:** `61ae3fc` (pre-session HEAD, clean tree, origin in sync).

**Retroactive fill:** user confirmed via AskUserQuestion that today's missed 14:00 UTC slot should be filled in. After deploy, POST `/daily-trigger` (force=true via admin secret) produces today's second piece. Natural 2026-04-23 02:00 UTC + 14:00 UTC slots continue uninterrupted.

**Verification:**
- Typecheck: 18 errors in `server.ts` (pre-existing SubAgent typing per CLAUDE.md convention), zero new errors in director.ts or observer.ts.
- Not previewable — change lives in the agents worker (Director DO), which doesn't render through the Astro preview server. Verification is live (after deploy) via admin observer feed + next cron slot.
- Post-deploy functional probes (in plan): guard-protects-within-slot, retroactive-fill-works, default-cadence-unaffected.

**Closes the follow-on claim:** CLAUDE.md "Multi-piece cadence plan — status" block updated to reflect the late-caught regression and its same-session fix. Next multi-per-day correctness audit should check `WHERE date = ?` guards explicitly, not just `WHERE run_id = ?` paths.

## 2026-04-22: Bump ElevenLabs per-attempt timeout 30s → 90s

**Context:** The 2026-04-22 run's audio pipeline failed with `"The operation was aborted due to timeout"` after 131 seconds wall time. Two beats reached R2 (`hook` at 798 chars, `the-core-problem` at 2375 chars), then the producer stalled on `why-the-debt-compounds` at 2960 chars. Three retries × 30s timeout + backoffs ≈ 93s burned before the whole producer threw. Observer logged an escalation; text was already live; admin retry button was the documented recovery path.

**Investigation:**
- Pipeline log for `run_id='2026-04-22'`: `audio-producing running` at T=400565, `failed` at T=532034 (131s).
- `daily_piece_audio` for piece `726b2abf`: 2 rows present (hook + the-core-problem), matching the "made it to R2 before stall" reading.
- Beat length audit on committed MDX: hook 798 / the-core-problem 2375 / why-the-debt-compounds **2960** / what-we-lose-by-waiting 3397 / close 120. Drafter originally emitted 8 beats (pipeline_log drafting step says `beatCount: 8`); final frontmatter is `beatCount: 5`, meaning the Integrator's round 1 revision compressed the structure. Individual beats ended up ~50% larger than the 2000-char target the original 30s timeout was sized against.
- Error text matches the standard `DOMException` from `AbortSignal.timeout` — confirms it's the per-attempt timeout firing, not an ElevenLabs 5xx or 4xx.

**Decision:** raise `callElevenLabs`'s per-attempt timeout from 30_000ms → 90_000ms at [agents/src/audio-producer.ts:313](../agents/src/audio-producer.ts:313) and update the associated comment with the new sizing rationale.

**Why 90s (not 60s, not streaming, not sub-chunking long beats):**
- The existing 30s comment assumed "~2000 chars typically returns in 5-15s; 30s is generous headroom". At 3000 chars + `speed: 0.95` (slower speech → longer audio → longer server-side work), ElevenLabs can legitimately take 30-60s on the *happy path*. Happy-path > 30s means the cap wasn't headroom at all, it was the limit.
- 60s would cover the observed 3000-char case but leaves no margin for ElevenLabs p99 spikes or the 3397-char `what-we-lose-by-waiting` beat queued right after.
- 90s gives ~6x typical happy-path latency; still well inside the alarm handler's 15-min wall-clock budget even in the absolute worst case (3 attempts × 90s + 1s + 2s ≈ 273s per beat, ~4.5min for the longest beat).
- Not sub-chunking long beats: would mean stitching audio at sentence boundaries, which corrupts prosody at the seam (prior-request-id stitching is ElevenLabs' answer to cross-call prosody, and that only works between complete responses). Out of proportion to the problem.
- Not switching to the streaming endpoint: streaming would start returning bytes sooner, but the producer currently buffers to R2 as one blob — converting means rewriting the write path + R2 object assembly. Not worth it for a 1-line fix that solves the observed failure mode.
- Kept `MAX_BEATS_PER_CHUNK = 2`: the DO-to-DO RPC wall-clock concern is blunted by `keepAlive()` + alarm-triggered invocation (per Phase F/G/H hardening in DECISIONS 2026-04-19). Two long beats in one chunk = 30-60s typical, 180s absolute worst case — the alarm handler tolerates that.

**Why not also add beat-name context to the error:** the observer event's reason text currently says `"The operation was aborted due to timeout"` with no beat identifier — *which* beat stalled has to be reconstructed from `daily_piece_audio` row presence. Useful, but orthogonal to this fix. Noted, not scoped in.

**Verification:** typecheck clean on the touched file. The 18 pre-existing SubAgent typing errors in `agents/src/server.ts` are unchanged (documented since Phase 2). No new errors introduced.

**Rollforward plan:** deploy agents worker; operator hits the **Continue** button on the admin per-piece page for 2026-04-22; producer's skip-if-exists-in-R2 logic will find hook + the-core-problem already in R2 and resume from beat 3. Expected total runtime ~45-60s for the three remaining beats at their happy-path latencies.

**Post-deploy verification (same day):** operator fired the Continue retry; `audio-producing running` at T=1776826754221, `audio-producing done` at T=1776826829247 — **75s across 2 chunks, zero per-attempt retries**. All three remaining beats completed inside the 90s cap on first attempt (2960 chars `why-the-debt-compounds`, 3384 chars `what-we-lose-by-waiting`, 118 chars `close`). Audio-auditor passed 5/5 beats = 9608 chars = 8.5MB. Publisher second-commit `9bc60b5` spliced `audioBeats:` into the MDX frontmatter. `daily_pieces.has_audio=1`. Close.

**Reference:** `c422bfc` raised `AbortSignal.timeout(30_000)` → `AbortSignal.timeout(90_000)` at `agents/src/audio-producer.ts`; followup commit closed AGENTS.md drift in the AudioProducer/AudioAuditor sections (method signatures + backoff schedule + timeout value), added this verification paragraph to DECISIONS + CLAUDE.md.

## 2026-04-22: Phase 7 FOLLOWUPS cleanup — five-commit wrap

**Context:** Five `[open]` FOLLOWUPS items remained after the cadence plan's main 14-commit run (ending at `c4caf39`). All Low priority. None blocked the cadence flip. Session brief: close them all in dependency order — cosmetics first, then the piece-id plumbing that later phases depend on, then the admin-route nesting + the reset-script work that benefit from that plumbing.

**Order (executed as five atomic commits):**

1. **`19910d7` — copy cleanup.** Ten files touched. Reader-visible marketing moved to neutral rhythm language ("every morning" / "each morning"); operational docs spell out the current default + configurable hook explicitly ("hourly cron gated by `admin_settings.interval_hours`, default 24 → only 02:00 UTC fires; admin-configurable"). Zita synthesis row in RUNBOOK updated from the old absolute 01:45 UTC day+1 to the Phase 6 relative `publish + 23h45m` reality. Dashboard footer, README intro, book chapters 8/9/99, src/pages/index.astro "no piece today" fallback, docs/{ARCHITECTURE, AGENTS, RUNBOOK}, CLAUDE.md project instructions all updated. Historical references deliberately left alone: append-only DECISIONS, handoff/ specs, book ch 10's forensic 2026-04-19 walkthrough. Dashboard hard-codes at lines 343 + 398 deferred to commit 2 (they'd be reabsorbed by the new `nextRunRelative`).

2. **`7ebae47` — cadence-aware `nextRunRelative`.** New [`src/lib/cadence.ts`](../src/lib/cadence.ts) holds five exports: `ALLOWED_INTERVAL_HOURS` (site-side mirror), `parseIntervalHours` (24 fallback), `getIntervalHours(db)` (admin_settings reader), `nextRunAtMs(nowMs, intervalHours)` (forward-scan from next top-of-hour for the first hour matching Director's gate), `nextRunRelative(nowMs, intervalHours)` ("Xh Ym" formatter). Dashboard reads `intervalHours` once at render time (defensive 24 fallback), passes through to the subtitle + pending-state hint + no-runs-in-7-days hint. 14 unit-test cases across `{1,2,3,4,6,12,24}` at two anchor times (`00:38 UTC` + `05:30 UTC`) all pass. Site-side `ALLOWED_INTERVAL_HOURS` duplication deduped: admin settings API imports from cadence.ts now. Agents-side copy at `agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts` stays separate — cross-worker, no shared imports.

3. **`9d20b81` — `engagement.piece_id`.** Migration 0017 rebuilds the table with PK `(piece_id, course_id, date)` (was `(lesson_id, course_id, date)`). `lesson_id` kept as a plain column for display-compat with admin widgets; piece_id is the new attribution axis. 13 historical rows backfilled via date-join on daily_pieces — 5 unique piece_ids, 0 NULLs after backfill. Snapshot `engagement_backup_20260422` held for 7-day rollback. Writer: rehype-beats reads `pieceId` from MDX frontmatter, injects `data-piece-id` on the auto-generated `<lesson-shell>`; lesson-shell POSTs it to `/api/engagement/track`. Endpoint falls back to a date-based lookup for stale bundles (arbitrary at multi-per-day — acceptable for the edge case; new bundles always send it). Reader path: `LearnerAgent.analyseAndLearn` reads piece_id off the row directly (no more date regex + lookup); `analyse()` GROUP BY piece_id so same-date pieces stay separate. `LessonMetric` + `UnderperformingLesson` interfaces gain `pieceId`. Admin widget query joins daily_pieces on piece_id, sorts by `published_at DESC`. Resolves the "Partial fix at multi-per-day" note in DECISIONS 2026-04-22 "writeLearning persists piece_id" §2.4.

4. **`3208c86` — admin per-piece route → `[date]/[slug]`.** `git mv` of the 845-line `[date].astro` → `[date]/[slug].astro` (92% similarity, history preserved). Resolves piece_id from the content collection entry matched on `(date, slug)`, then scopes per-piece queries: `daily_pieces WHERE id = ?`, `daily_piece_audio WHERE piece_id = ?`, `zita_messages WHERE piece_id = ?`. Day-scoped queries unchanged per Phase 3 walk-back + Phase 6 reasoning (audit_results, pipeline_log, daily_candidates, observer_events all intentionally show "today's pipeline activity"). Breadcrumb adds slug segment; "View on site" link uses `pieceUrl(date, slug)` directly. New `[date]/index.astro` handles legacy URLs: 1 piece → 302 to the slug URL; 2+ pieces (multi-per-day) → disambiguation list sorted by `publishedAt DESC`; 0 pieces → "No piece" display. Admin home uses a new `adminPieceHref(date, pieceId?)` helper backed by a piece_id→slug map from `getCollection('dailyPieces')` with graceful fallback to `{date}/`. zita.astro's deep-link left as `{date}/` — hits the new index.astro which routes correctly. Retry-audio + zita-synthesis trigger buttons still pass `?date=` — existing server handlers already resolve piece_id via `ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 1` which matches the "latest" semantic at multi-per-day. Leaving scope creep off this commit.

5. **`205ce1e` — `reset-today.sh --piece-id`.** Default mode unchanged (full-day reset). New `--piece-id <uuid>` flag scopes the wipe to that piece across 7 piece-id-capable tables (daily_pieces, daily_candidates, audit_results, daily_piece_audio, zita_messages, learnings, engagement). Two piece-id-less tables (pipeline_log — date-keyed per Phase 3 walk-back; observer_events — no piece_id column) use a ±20min `published_at`-centred window, mirroring Learner's `LEARNER_PIPELINE_LOOKBACK_MS/LOOKAHEAD_MS` math for same-reason same-answer (stressed-pipeline tolerance without bleeding into neighbouring same-date pieces). `--retrigger` opt-in flag fires `/daily-trigger` after the wipe (default is wipe-only; single-piece re-run has no natural cron slot at multi-per-day, operator makes the trigger decision explicitly). UUID validation prevents silent-zero-rows DELETE on typos. ADMIN_SECRET only required when a trigger actually fires — a dry wipe-only run works secret-free. RUNBOOK updated with both modes.

**Why in this order.** Dependency-first:
- #1 and #2 are prose + small helpers. No risk. Done first so later commits land in a clean linting/lint-free base.
- #3 (engagement rebuild) is the schema foundation. Later commits #4 + #5 depend on piece_id being on the engagement table (admin widget + reset script both touch it).
- #4 uses the piece_id→slug map (introduced by #3's rehype change) for its link helper.
- #5 uses every piece_id-capable table added across the cadence plan + #3.

**Verification per commit:**
- #1: preview-live dashboard confirmed `each morning` footer + no lingering `2am UTC` anywhere on served pages.
- #2: 14/14 unit-test cases pass in a Node scratch run; preview confirms subtitle + hint + no-runs-state all say "in Xh Ym".
- #3: remote migration applied clean (0017 ✅); 13/13 rows preserved, 5/5 piece_ids populated, 0 NULLs; preview confirms `data-piece-id` attr live on `<lesson-shell>`; engagement POST returns 200 both with and without piece_id in body.
- #4: `pnpm build` clean; `/dashboard/admin/piece/{date}/` + `/{slug}/` + bogus-slug URLs all return 302 to /login (admin gate fires before routing, as designed).
- #5: `bash -n` syntax check passes; `--help` output matches docstring; arg validation rejects missing UUID, malformed UUID, and unknown flags with distinct error messages.

**Non-goals:**
- No touch to `/audio-retry` or `/zita-synthesis-trigger` endpoint signatures — they still accept `?date=` and resolve piece_id via latest-by-date. Close to correct at multi-per-day; changing requires updating site-worker + agents-worker handlers together. Tracked implicitly under "existing latest-by-date heuristic is fine".
- No `daily_candidates.selected` investigation (separate `[open]` FOLLOWUPS since 2026-04-21).
- No change to legacy audit_results + daily_candidates + observer_events admin queries (still date-keyed — intentional day-view per Phase 3 walk-back).
- No `engagement_backup_20260422` drop — held for 7-day rollback window, queued as new FOLLOWUPS for 2026-04-29.

**Flip status:** unchanged. Production cadence stays `interval_hours=24`. The five-commit wrap takes the FOLLOWUPS list from 5 `[open]` → 0 `[open]` + 1 new snapshot-drop entry. No new open correctness blockers. Every cosmetic and attribution-at-multi-per-day gap from the cadence plan is now closed.

**References:** commits `19910d7`, `7ebae47`, `9d20b81`, `3208c86`, `205ce1e`. FOLLOWUPS entries 1–5 of 2026-04-22 all resolved; FOLLOWUPS "Drop `engagement_backup_20260422` snapshot" queued for 2026-04-29.

---

## 2026-04-22: `writeLearning` persists `piece_id` — last multi-per-day correctness blocker resolved

**Context:** The FOLLOWUPS entry surfaced during Phase 6 scoping — `writeLearning(…, pieceDate)` wrote `learnings.piece_date` but not `learnings.piece_id`, so the made-drawer's per-piece "What the system learned" section queried `WHERE piece_date = ?` and would pool learnings across same-date pieces at multi-per-day cadence. The only blocker listed in CLAUDE.md's cadence-plan top status between "Phases 1-6 shipped" and "admin can safely flip `interval_hours<24`."

**Decision:** extend `writeLearning` to take `pieceId` as an 8th required arg, thread it through all four callers + the Director schedule payloads, add `pieceId: z.string()` to the content collection schema, backfill the 5 existing MDX files, teach Director to splice `pieceId` into frontmatter at publish time (alongside the existing `voiceScore` + `publishedAt` splices), teach MadeBy / made-drawer / the `/api/daily/[date]/made` endpoint to pass and filter by `piece_id` when present. Fall back to `piece_date` in the API when `pieceId` query param is absent — defensive, since all 5 existing pieces now have `pieceId` in frontmatter.

**Six changes:**

**1. `writeLearning` signature** — 8th parameter `pieceId: string`. Defensive check refuses INSERT if pieceId is null/empty/non-string (same shape as existing checks for source + pieceDate). INSERT writes to `learnings.piece_id` column added in migration 0014 (previously nullable; still nullable at schema level, but every new row from this commit onwards has it populated by the writer). `logMissingField`'s union widened to include `'piece_id'`.

**2. Four callers updated:**
- `Learner.analysePiecePostPublish` (producer-synth) — already had `pieceId` in signature post-Phase-6-blocker-#3. Pass to writeLearning.
- `Learner.analyseZitaPatternsDaily` (Zita synth) — already had `pieceId` post-Phase-6. Pass through.
- `Drafter.reflect` — signature extended `reflect(brief, mdx, date)` → `reflect(brief, mdx, date, pieceId)`. Director's `reflectOnPieceScheduled` payload gains `pieceId`; the schedule call at publish time passes the captured UUID.
- `Learner.analyseAndLearn` (reader-engagement) — no piece_id in scope at call time. Resolves via `SELECT id FROM daily_pieces WHERE date = ? LIMIT 1`. **Partial fix at multi-per-day** — picks an arbitrary same-date piece when multiple exist. Engagement attribution correctness at multi-per-day would need a separate `engagement.piece_id` column + lesson-shell writer update; out of scope here. Documented in FOLLOWUPS comment and code.

**3. Director splices `pieceId` into frontmatter at publish time.** Right after the existing `publishedAt` splice, same regex pattern. `pieceId = crypto.randomUUID()` moved to the top of the frontmatter-splice block (was declared just before the daily_pieces INSERT) so both the splice and the INSERT use the same value. `publishedAtMs` moved up alongside for the same symmetry.

**4. Content collection schema** — `pieceId: z.string()` required (not optional). All 5 existing MDX files backfilled with their prod D1 UUIDs in the same commit. Build validation proves all 5 pass the new schema before any runtime sees the change.

**5. 5 MDX frontmatter backfills** — one line each: `pieceId: "<uuid>"`. UUIDs pulled from session memory of prod D1 reads (2026-04-21). Metadata carve-out under the permanence rule (same precedent as `publishedAt`, `voiceScore`, `audioBeats`, `beatTitles`, `qualityFlag`).

**6. Made-drawer end-to-end:**
- `src/components/MadeBy.astro` — accepts `pieceId: string` prop; passes as `data-piece-id` HTML attribute.
- `src/pages/daily/[date]/[slug].astro` — passes `piece.data.pieceId` to MadeBy.
- `src/interactive/made-drawer.ts` — reads `data-piece-id` attr; appends `?pieceId=<uuid>` to the fetch URL when present.
- `src/pages/api/daily/[date]/made.ts` — accepts `?pieceId=` query param; learnings SELECT uses `WHERE piece_id = ?` when provided; falls back to `WHERE piece_date = ?` when absent (defensive — in practice every piece from this commit has pieceId).

**Why not piece-id-filter every section, only learnings?** The made-drawer also renders timeline (pipeline_log), audit rounds (audit_results), candidates (daily_candidates), and audio (daily_piece_audio). Per Phase 3 walk-back + Phase 6 reasoning, the pipeline_log + daily_candidates sections are legitimately day-view at multi-per-day ("today's pipeline activity" + "today's candidate pool before Curator picked"). daily_piece_audio is already piece-id scoped post-Phase-1 but filtered here by date for the same day-view shape. Audit_results is keyed by `task_id` which encodes date — same. Only learnings had the specific cross-piece-leakage bug this commit fixes; extending the filter to all four would be scope creep with no correctness payoff at 1/day and a mixed story at multi/day.

**Regex for pieceId query param validation** — `/^[0-9a-f-]{32,40}$/i`. Matches UUID v4 shape (36 chars with hyphens) with slack for alternative encodings. Defensive — a bad pieceId param falls back to the piece_date query instead of hitting D1 with garbage.

**Non-goals:**
- No `engagement.piece_id` column — reader-path attribution at multi-per-day is a separate FOLLOWUPS item (the one this entry references). Partial-fix semantics documented in Learner code comment.
- No change to the other made-drawer sections (pipeline, audits, candidates, audio). Day-view semantics preserved.
- No migration. `learnings.piece_id` column has been present since migration 0014; only the writer path and reader filter change here.

**Verified:**
- Agents TypeScript check clean (18 pre-existing SubAgent errors unchanged).
- `pnpm build` produces all 5 pages at the new URL shape with the new `pieceId` field required — all 5 MDX pass the schema.
- Preview verified: made-drawer `data-piece-id` attr populated, `/api/daily/[date]/made?pieceId=<uuid>` filters correctly (seeded a test row with matching piece_id, confirmed it returns only under the matching param and under the no-param fallback, not under a non-matching piece_id).

**Flip status:** with this commit, `interval_hours` can be flipped below 24 without any known correctness blockers. The made-drawer's per-piece learnings section will display scoped data at multi-per-day. The `engagement.piece_id` attribution gap remains open but doesn't surface in any current reader view (engagement writes are consumed by Learner's reader-path only).

## 2026-04-21: Multi-piece cadence — Phase 6 Zita synthesis timing + piece_id scoping

**Context:** Phase 6 "downstream adaptation" from the plan. Scoped tightly to the items that break at the multi-per-day interval flip:

- **Zita synthesis timing** — was an absolute clock target (01:45 UTC day+1) that would have stacked N pieces' synth jobs on one clock at multi-per-day AND given same-date afternoon pieces only a partial reader window. Fixed.
- **Zita synthesis scoping** — `analyseZitaPatternsDaily(date)` queried `zita_messages WHERE piece_date = ?` and `daily_pieces WHERE date = ?`. At multi-per-day both pooled across pieces sharing a date. Fixed.
- **Scanner / Curator** — audited and found **no change needed.** `getRecentDailyPieces(30)` already uses `WHERE date >= <30d-ago>` which includes today's pieces. Curator's prompt already says "avoid repetition" against that list. At multi-per-day, today's prior picks are already in the avoidance list — the concern from the original plan briefing turned out to already be handled. No code change.

**Decisions:**

**1. Zita synth fires at relative delay `publish + 23h45m` (= 85500s).** Was `Date.UTC(y, m, d+1, 1, 45)` absolute. Same ~24h window regardless of publish time. At multi-per-day, each piece's synth fires at its own publish+23h45m mark — N pieces → N independent alarm targets, no stacking. At the tightest cadence (1h), synths are separated by 1h each, well within the SDK's alarm queue behaviour.

**2. `analyseZitaPatternsDaily(date)` → `analyseZitaPatternsDaily(pieceId, date)`.** piece_id primary; date retained for result-shape compatibility (the return value still carries `date` for observer event logging). `zita_messages` filter switches to `WHERE piece_id = ?` (column was 100% backfilled during Phase 1). `daily_pieces` filter switches to `WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1`.

**3. Director's `analyseZitaPatternsScheduled` payload gains `pieceId`.** Threaded through from `triggerDailyPiece`'s captured piece_id (same variable that was added for the audio pipeline in Commit 2 of the multi-per-day blocker sequence).

**4. Server's `/zita-synthesis-trigger` endpoint resolves `piece_id` from `?date=...`.** Same pattern as `/audio-retry` — admin UI still hits with date, endpoint looks up piece_id via `daily_pieces ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 1`. At multi-per-day this picks the latest piece for that date, matching the "trigger the most recent" shape.

**Why 85500s (23h45m) and not 86400s (24h).** Leaves a 15-minute margin before the next day's equivalent-slot pipeline would start. At interval_hours=24 (current prod), the 02:00 UTC cron fires the pipeline — synth at publish+23h45m lands at roughly 01:45-02:00 UTC day+1, before the next pipeline starts, mirroring the original absolute-clock intent. At multi-per-day (1h), synths are decoupled from the cron entirely — the 15-min margin doesn't matter, but the number stays the same so behaviour at 24h cadence is unchanged from the absolute-clock version.

**Scanner/Curator audit (no change):** `getRecentDailyPieces(30)` at [`agents/src/director.ts`](../agents/src/director.ts) currently returns headlines from `daily_pieces WHERE date >= <since>` where `since` is 30 days back from now. At multi-per-day with piece A published at 02:00 UTC and Curator running at 06:00 UTC, A's row has `date = today` and matches the `>= <30-days-ago>` bound. Curator's prompt at [`agents/src/curator-prompt.ts`](../agents/src/curator-prompt.ts) labels this list "Already published in last 30 days (avoid repetition)" — the label is slightly misleading at multi-per-day (today IS in the list), but the substantive guidance ("avoid repetition") still applies correctly. Label rewording is Phase 7 cosmetic, not a correctness issue.

**Touched files:**
- [`agents/src/director.ts`](../agents/src/director.ts) — `triggerDailyPiece` zita schedule (relative delay + pieceId in payload); `analyseZitaPatternsScheduled` accepts pieceId.
- [`agents/src/learner.ts`](../agents/src/learner.ts) — `analyseZitaPatternsDaily(pieceId, date)` signature + both SELECT updates.
- [`agents/src/server.ts`](../agents/src/server.ts) — `/zita-synthesis-trigger` resolves pieceId from date before invoking Director.

**Non-goals (deferred):**
- **writeLearning piece_id extension** — new follow-up surfaced while scoping this. `writeLearning(db, category, observation, evidence, confidence, source, pieceDate)` writes `learnings.piece_date` but not `learnings.piece_id`. At multi-per-day the made-drawer's `WHERE piece_date = ?` query pools learnings across same-date pieces. Cross-cutting fix (4 callers: producer-synth, reflect, reader-learn, zita-synth). New FOLLOWUPS entry. Not bundled into this commit.
- **"Days running" stat rename.** Cosmetic at multi-per-day. Phase 7.
- **Observer dashboard grouping by piece_id.** UX polish. Phase 7.
- **`scripts/reset-today.sh --piece-id` flag.** Operational tool. Phase 7.
- **Zita synth run frequency at multi-per-day.** One synth per piece means 24 Claude calls/day at the tightest cadence vs 1/day today. Acceptable — each guarded by the ≥5 user-msgs threshold which most pieces will fail until reader traffic grows. If spend becomes a concern, revisit.

**Verification:**
- Agents TypeScript check clean on touched files. 18 pre-existing SubAgent DurableObjectStub errors in server.ts unchanged.
- Next pipeline run schedules Zita synth at `publish + 85500s`. Observer event `Zita synthesis (metered)` fires at that offset, not at 01:45 UTC absolute.
- At multi-per-day flip: two pieces on the same date get two independent synth alarms; Learner queries zita_messages by piece_id so each synthesis sees only its own piece's conversations.

## 2026-04-21: Multi-piece cadence — Phase 5 admin settings UI

**Context:** Phase 5 of the cadence plan. With blockers #1 #2 #3 resolved (commits `ecedb87` + `900905d` + `30ddbdd`), flipping `interval_hours` below 24 is architecturally safe. Phase 5 ships the admin-facing knob.

**Decision:**

1. **New admin page** [`src/pages/dashboard/admin/settings.astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/settings.astro) — ADMIN_EMAIL-gated (standard admin redirect pattern), dropdown populated from `ALLOWED_INTERVAL_HOURS = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]` (divisors of 24; non-divisors rejected for the rhythm-drift reason documented in Phase 1 decision #4). Shows current value + `updated_at` timestamp read from `admin_settings` at render time. Select option labels describe each choice — e.g. `4h — 6 pieces per day · every 4 hours` — so the operational meaning is visible inline without a separate legend.

2. **New API endpoint** [`src/pages/api/dashboard/admin/settings.ts`](../src/pages/api/dashboard/admin/settings.ts) exposes GET + POST, both ADMIN_EMAIL-gated (401 otherwise, matching the `observer.ts` precedent).
   - GET returns `{interval_hours, updated_at, allowed_intervals}`.
   - POST validates `body.interval_hours` against the allowed set (400 otherwise), upserts `admin_settings` via `INSERT … ON CONFLICT(key) DO UPDATE`, and fires an `admin_settings_changed` observer_event with `{type, key, prior, next, changedBy, changedAt}` context. Prior value captured BEFORE the UPSERT so the event shows the full transition. Uses the existing [`src/lib/observer-events.ts`](../src/lib/observer-events.ts) helper (Phase 2 site-worker → observer_events writer).

3. **Navigation** — new "Settings →" link in top-right of [`src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro), alongside the existing "Zita activity →" link. Consistent pattern for admin subsections.

4. **No CSRF token.** Matches the existing `/api/dashboard/observer` POST handler (which also lacks CSRF). The same-site cookie gating via admin-session is the current boundary. If the admin API set a CSRF pattern later, this endpoint inherits it at that time.

**`ALLOWED_INTERVAL_HOURS` duplication (deliberate).** The agents worker ([`agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts`](../agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts)) and the site worker (this new endpoint) don't share imports — two separate packages. The constant is copied into both. Defensive layers handle drift:
- POST validates against the site-side set (rejects out-of-set values).
- Agents-side `parseIntervalHours` falls back to 24 for anything not in the agents-side set.
- So a drift fails safe — it either blocks the admin write, or silently reverts to 24 at Director read time. Neither silently runs at an unintended cadence.

A comment in the endpoint flags this coupling explicitly so a future audit doesn't miss one side.

**Why the 1-1-1 triangle (read on mount, write on submit, read back on save) instead of an optimistic-update flow.** The page re-displays the server-returned `interval_hours` + `updated_at` values after POST success. This confirms to the operator what actually got written — if the write partially fails or a bug returns a different value than what was submitted, the UI reflects reality rather than the optimistic hope. At one-per-day admin usage the server round-trip is imperceptible.

**Audit trail design.** The `admin_settings_changed` event severity is `info`, not `warn` — this is expected admin behaviour, not an anomaly. The event body spells out prior → next + the changed-by email + the "effective next hourly cron alarm (up to 1h from now)" expectation so operators reading the Observer feed later see what happened AND when it took effect without cross-referencing other tables.

**Verified (build + preview):**
- `pnpm build` clean; the new page + endpoint are in the server bundle.
- Unauth'd GET /api/dashboard/admin/settings → 401. Unauth'd POST → 401. Unauth'd page → 302 to `/login/?redirect=…` (via `Astro.redirect`).
- Build's prerender step still renders the existing 5 daily pieces at their new nested slug URLs (Phase 4 still intact).

**Non-goals:**
- No validation of "is the value safe to flip NOW." The 3 blockers that would have made this unsafe are all resolved pre-Phase-5. If a future change reintroduces a multi-per-day risk, re-add a block here.
- No UI warning banner when admin picks a value other than 24. Nothing currently breaks at other values — blockers are clear.
- No historic log of cadence changes on the Settings page itself. The Observer feed at `/dashboard/admin/` already shows them (with full prior→next detail in the event context), so a second view would be redundant.
- No change to the `/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/` route's date-keyed URL. That's a separate Phase 5/6 concern for admin UX at multi-per-day; reader-facing URLs are already piece-scoped post-Phase-4.
- No new migration. `admin_settings` table already exists from Phase 2 (migration 0016).

**Post-deploy verification contract** (real-world, authenticated):
- Admin visits `/dashboard/admin/settings/` → page renders dropdown with current value selected.
- Admin picks 4h and clicks Save → status line reads "Saved. Effective next hourly cron alarm (up to 1h)."
- `SELECT * FROM admin_settings WHERE key = 'interval_hours'` on remote D1 shows value='4' with fresh `updated_at`.
- `SELECT * FROM observer_events WHERE json_extract(context, '$.type') = 'admin_settings_changed' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1` shows the change event with prior='24', next='4', `changedBy` = admin email.
- Next hourly cron alarm at 02:00/06:00/10:00/14:00/18:00/22:00 UTC fires the pipeline (gate: `(hour-2+24)%4 === 0`), other hours silent-bail.

## 2026-04-21: Scope Learner synthesis input by time window (multi-per-day unblock, #3 — final)

**Context:** Commit 3 of 3. Completes the multi-per-day unblock sequence from Phase 3's pipeline_log consumer audit. [`agents/src/learner.ts:338`](../agents/src/learner.ts) ran `SELECT … FROM pipeline_log WHERE run_id = ? .bind(date)` to feed Claude's producer-learning synthesis. At 1 piece/day, pipeline_log for a date = exactly one run. At multi-per-day it pooled all that day's pieces' steps → synthesis for piece A saw piece B/C/D's candidate picks, audit rounds, etc. Noise that corrupts the learning output.

**Boundary question:** how to filter "just this piece's pipeline rows" without breaking the run_id walk-back (which keeps `run_id = YYYY-MM-DD` and rejects a piece_id column on pipeline_log for one consumer).

**Options considered:**
1. Add `pipeline_log.piece_id` column. Cleanest filter. Conflicts with the run_id walk-back (one consumer ≠ schema axis).
2. Time-window filter via `daily_pieces.published_at`.
3. Read `pipeline_log.data` JSON for identity markers. Not all rows identify which piece they belong to.
4. Skip pipeline_log entirely, use piece's own MDX. Loses real signal (audit rounds, candidates skipped vs picked, revisions required).

**Decision (implemented):** Option 2. Time-window filter.

**Implementation:**

1. **Signature change** — `analysePiecePostPublish(date)` → `analysePiecePostPublish(pieceId, date)`. piece_id primary; date carried only for the pipeline_log `run_id` match. Caller at Director (`analyseProducerSignalsScheduled`) payload gains `pieceId` — flowed from the `crypto.randomUUID()` captured at daily_pieces INSERT time (Commit 2 already did this capture).
2. **daily_pieces SELECT** switches from `WHERE date = ? LIMIT 1` to `WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1`. At multi-per-day the date-keyed version would have picked an arbitrary piece; piece-id-keyed pulls the specific piece.
3. **pipeline_log SELECT** gains `AND created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?` with `[piece.published_at - 600_000, piece.published_at + 600_000]`. 10min pre-publish + 10min post-publish = 20min total. Fallback to unbounded window when `published_at IS NULL` (legacy pre-Phase-4 rows).
4. **Two constants** at top of [`agents/src/learner.ts`](../agents/src/learner.ts): `LEARNER_PIPELINE_LOOKBACK_MS = 600_000`, `LEARNER_PIPELINE_LOOKAHEAD_MS = 600_000`. Named so future adjustment is a single-edit change.

**Why 20min total window (not 6min as originally drafted).** Zishan's stress-case pushback: pipelines are ~2min nominal but can exceed 5min under Anthropic API latency spikes, ElevenLabs retry storms, or DO alarm re-dispatch. A 6min window works at happy-path latency and silently truncates under stress — the exact silent-data-loss shape we were trying to prevent with this change. 20min is ~4x the observed-under-stress worst case. Gap between two runs at `interval_hours=1` is 60min, so 20min still leaves 40min safety margin on both sides. Generous wins over tight here.

**Why not Option 1 (pipeline_log.piece_id column).** Same discipline as the run_id walk-back: adding a piece_id column for one consumer is exactly the pattern that caused the 2026-04-21 regression. If a second or third consumer emerges needing per-piece pipeline filtering, revisit.

**Why keep the date argument on the signature.** pipeline_log is keyed by `run_id = date`. Filtering by piece_id on pipeline_log isn't possible (no column, by deliberate choice). The time-window filter needs both the date (to match run_id) and the piece's publishedAt (to bound created_at). Two values, two parameters.

**Touched files:**
- [`agents/src/learner.ts`](../agents/src/learner.ts) — constants, signature change, two SELECT updates.
- [`agents/src/director.ts`](../agents/src/director.ts) — `analyseProducerSignalsScheduled` payload gains `pieceId`; the schedule call at publish time passes it; internal call to `learner.analysePiecePostPublish(pieceId, date)`.

**Non-goals:**
- No change to `analyseZitaPatternsDaily` (the Zita-source Learner path) or `reflect` (Drafter self-reflection). Those scope by piece_date (zita) or filePath (reflect) already. Revisit if they grow the same date-pooling bug at multi-per-day.
- No retrospective re-run of Learner on historical pieces. The 5 existing pieces' synthesis ran under pre-fix semantics when only one piece existed per date.
- No new schema.

**Verification:**
- Agents TypeScript check clean on both touched files. 18 pre-existing SubAgent DurableObjectStub errors in server.ts unchanged.
- At 1 piece/day (tonight's cron): time-window filter returns same rows as the old run_id filter because pipeline starts + publishes fit well inside the 20-min window.
- At multi-per-day (when admin flips): time-window filter returns only the target piece's rows, excluding neighbouring pieces on the same date.

**Sequence closure:** blockers #1 (pre-run DELETE removed in `ecedb87`), #2 (audio pipeline piece_id scoping in `900905d`), and #3 (this commit) all land. FOLLOWUPS entry "Unblock multi-per-day flip" marked resolved. Phase 5 (admin UI for interval flip) can ship next with no restrictions on the dropdown.

## 2026-04-21: Scope audio pipeline state per piece_id (multi-per-day unblock, #2 + R2 key fix)

**Context:** Commit 2 of the 3-blocker sequence. Phase 3's audit flagged [`director.ts:783`](../agents/src/director.ts) — `retryAudioFresh(date)` issued `DELETE FROM pipeline_log WHERE run_id = ? AND step LIKE 'audio%'` keyed by date. At 1 piece/day this correctly wipes "today's audio retry" state. At multi-per-day the same DELETE wipes across all pieces that share a date. Blocked the admin interval flip.

**Plus a fourth blocker found while scoping this one.** The audio producer at [`agents/src/audio-producer.ts`](../agents/src/audio-producer.ts) wrote to R2 at `audio/daily/{brief.date}/{beat.name}.mp3` — date-scoped, not piece-scoped. Two pieces sharing a date have overlapping beat names (every piece has a "hook" beat) that would silently overwrite each other in R2. Same multi-per-day blocker theme — fixed in the same commit.

**Plus a latent critical bug caught while reading the code.** `persistBeatRow` at [`agents/src/audio-producer.ts`](../agents/src/audio-producer.ts) INSERTed `(date, beat_name, r2_key, …)` — but Phase 1's migration 0015 rebuilt `daily_piece_audio` with PK `(piece_id, beat_name)` + `piece_id TEXT NOT NULL`. The INSERT without a `piece_id` binding would have hit a NOT NULL violation on EVERY new piece's audio generation. No piece has run through the pipeline since Phase 1 landed earlier today — existing 5 pieces hit R2 head-check before the INSERT, so the bug was latent. Tonight's 02:00 UTC cron would have been the first to trip it. Unblocking audio generation going forward was a bigger motivator for this commit than the multi-per-day story it was scoped for.

**Five decisions (now implemented):**

**1. `retryAudioFresh` takes a `piece_id`, not a `date`.** Signature changed `retryAudioFresh(date: string)` → `retryAudioFresh(pieceId: string)`. Same for `retryAudio(date)` → `retryAudio(pieceId)`. Both validate the incoming string matches the UUID v4 shape. `retryAudio` derives `date` internally from `daily_pieces WHERE id = ?`. The site worker's `/audio-retry` endpoint still accepts `?date=...` from the admin UI but now looks up piece_id from `daily_pieces` (`ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 1` — at multi-per-day picks the most recent piece for the date, which matches the "retry the latest" intent).

**2. `daily_piece_audio` is the single source of truth for piece audio state.** Post-Phase-1 the table's PK is `(piece_id, beat_name)`. Retry-fresh iterates `daily_piece_audio WHERE piece_id = ?`, calls `AUDIO_BUCKET.delete(row.r2_key)` for each stored r2_key verbatim, then `DELETE FROM daily_piece_audio WHERE piece_id = ?`. `r2_key` holds the full path used at generation time — no path reconstruction. Works for both legacy and new-format keys.

**3. R2 key structure gains a piece_id component going forward.** New format: `audio/daily/{date}/{piece_id}/{beat_name}.mp3`. The 5 existing pieces' R2 objects stay at the old 1-level path (`audio/daily/{date}/{beat}.mp3`) — no rename, no re-upload (permanence rule). `daily_piece_audio.r2_key` records the full path per-row, so the audio delivery layer must tolerate both shapes permanently. See the "Dual-path read contract" below.

**Dual-path read contract — permanent.** The audio-serving path must tolerate BOTH key shapes forever: `audio/daily/{date}/{beat}.mp3` for the 5 legacy pieces, `audio/daily/{date}/{piece_id}/{beat}.mp3` for everything from this commit onwards. The `daily_piece_audio.r2_key` column is authoritative per-row; no code should reconstruct paths from `(date, beat_name)` tuples. Called out explicitly so a future audit of `/audio/*` routing or R2 binding logic doesn't assume a single-shape world and break the legacy pieces.

**4. Removed the `DELETE FROM pipeline_log` from retry-fresh entirely.** Audio-step pipeline_log rows stay as append-only audit history. Admin view dedups by newest-wins; a fresh retry fires new `audio-*` step rows that naturally supersede the old failed attempt's rows in any "current state" query. Resolves the multi-per-day blocker with zero data loss.

**5. No schema change.** Migrations 0014/0015 already established `daily_piece_audio.piece_id` NOT NULL. This commit is code-only on top of the existing schema. The latent `persistBeatRow` bug documented above is fixed by threading `pieceId` through the audio brief (`AudioBrief.pieceId`, `AudioAuditBrief.pieceId`) and the call chain (`triggerDailyPiece` captures the UUID before INSERT → schedules `runAudioPipelineScheduled({pieceId, date, …})` → `runAudioPipeline(pieceId, date, …)` → `generateAudioChunk({pieceId, date}, …)` / `auditor.audit({pieceId, date})` → `persistBeatRow(pieceId, date, beat)` INSERTs with piece_id in the `(piece_id, beat_name, date, …)` column order).

**Touched files:**
- [`agents/src/audio-producer.ts`](../agents/src/audio-producer.ts) — `AudioBrief` adds `pieceId`; r2Key gets piece_id subdirectory; prior-request-id SELECT + COUNT switch to `WHERE piece_id = ?`; `persistBeatRow(pieceId, date, beat)` INSERTs piece_id.
- [`agents/src/audio-auditor.ts`](../agents/src/audio-auditor.ts) — `AudioAuditBrief` adds `pieceId`; `loadRows(pieceId)` filters by piece_id.
- [`agents/src/director.ts`](../agents/src/director.ts) — piece_id captured into local var before `daily_pieces` INSERT; threaded through audio schedule payload, `runAudioPipelineScheduled`, `runAudioPipeline`, `retryAudio`, `retryAudioFresh`; audio-publisher SELECT + has_audio UPDATE switch to piece_id.
- [`agents/src/server.ts`](../agents/src/server.ts) — `/audio-retry` endpoint looks up piece_id from `daily_pieces WHERE date = ? ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 1` before invoking the Director RPC.

**Non-goals (deferred):**
- No Learner-side piece_id threading (blocker #3, next commit).
- No frontend change to the admin retry button. It still POSTs `?date=...`; server-side lookup handles the conversion to piece_id. If admin UX gains a "retry a specific piece" control at multi-per-day, the endpoint can accept `?pieceId=...` as an alternative.
- No re-upload of the 5 legacy pieces' R2 objects to the new nested path. Their `daily_piece_audio.r2_key` values record the old path verbatim.

**Verification:**
- Agents TypeScript check clean on all four touched files. 18 pre-existing SubAgent DurableObjectStub errors in server.ts unchanged.
- Next 02:00 UTC cron fire is the runtime smoke test — piece gets a UUID, audio persists with piece_id populated, R2 key lands at the new nested path.
- Retry-fresh at 1/day: admin hits the button with date, endpoint resolves piece_id, RPC wipes that piece's audio and delegates to retryAudio. Legacy pieces' retry would delete old-format R2 keys via the stored r2_key column — exercising the dual-path contract.

## 2026-04-21: Remove pre-run `pipeline_log` DELETE (multi-per-day unblock, #1)

**Context:** Commit 1 of the 3-blocker sequence flagged by Phase 3's pipeline_log consumer audit. [`director.ts:109`](../agents/src/director.ts) ran `DELETE FROM pipeline_log WHERE run_id = ? .bind(today)` at the top of `triggerDailyPiece`. At 1 piece/day the DELETE correctly clears stale rows from an earlier interrupted attempt on the same date. At multi-per-day (admin flipping `interval_hours` below 24) the same DELETE wipes all earlier completed runs' pipeline_log history from the same date when a new run starts — silent audit-trail loss.

**Decision:** Remove the DELETE entirely. `pipeline_log` accumulates append-only.

**Why:**
- Storage cost is negligible. At the tightest cadence (`interval_hours=1`), ~20-30 rows per piece × 24 pieces/day = ~480-720 rows/day, ~15-22k rows/month. Small TEXT + JSON rows in D1.
- The "stale interrupted attempt" concern at 1/day is already covered by the `WHERE date=? existing` guard a few lines up in `triggerDailyPiece`: a run won't fire if today's piece exists. If a prior attempt crashed without INSERTing into `daily_pieces`, its pipeline_log rows stay as honest forensic history of the crash rather than being silently erased on the next attempt.
- Manual wipe path stays at `scripts/reset-today.sh` for operators who want to reset a day.
- Admin view ([`dashboard/admin.astro:136-141`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro)) already dedups via "last step per run_id via `WHERE created_at = MAX(...)`" pattern — accumulated rows don't pollute the live pipeline monitor.

**What changed:** One line removed + the comment above it. `triggerDailyPiece` now flows directly from the existence guard into the cadence-config read (Phase 2's `getAdminSetting` call).

**Verification contract:**
- Next 02:00 UTC cron run fires, produces a piece, pipeline_log gets ~19-31 new rows for that date. The 5 historical run_ids (2026-04-17 → 2026-04-21) stay intact.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pipeline_log` grows monotonically from this point forward. No DELETE path except the explicit `scripts/reset-today.sh`.

**Non-goals for this commit:**
- No changes to `retryAudioFresh`'s audio-step pipeline_log DELETE (that's blocker #2, own commit next).
- No changes to Learner's pipeline_log SELECT (that's blocker #3, own commit after).

## 2026-04-21: Multi-piece cadence — Phase 4 URL routing + `publishedAt` tiebreaker

**Context:** Phase 4 of the cadence plan. Readers' daily-piece URLs shift from `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` to `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/slug/` so multiple pieces can coexist on the same date. Phase 1 decision #1 (URL option B, nested) + refinement 1 (no 301 redirect layer — dev phase, 5 pieces, no bookmarks). The homepage hero and library lists pick up a `publishedAt DESC` tiebreaker so same-date pieces sort deterministically.

**Decision:** four concrete changes, no new migration.

1. **New nested route** [`src/pages/daily/[date]/[slug].astro`](../src/pages/daily/[date]/[slug].astro) replaces the old flat `[date].astro`. `getStaticPaths` emits `{date, slug}` tuples; slug derives from `entry.id` (Astro's filename-without-extension) via [`src/lib/slug.ts`](../src/lib/slug.ts) `deriveSlug(entryId)` which strips the 11-char `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix. At 5 existing pieces this produces the same filename-encoded slug that Director has been generating at publish time since launch (`brief.headline.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-').slice(0, 60)`).

2. **`publishedAt: z.number()`** added to the content-collection schema. 5 existing MDX frontmatters backfilled with their `daily_pieces.published_at` values from D1 — single-line `publishedAt: <ms>` additions under the metadata carve-out (same precedent as `voiceScore`, `audioBeats`, `beatTitles`, `qualityFlag`). Going forward, Director splices `publishedAt: Date.now()` into frontmatter at publish time alongside the existing `voiceScore` splice. The same `publishedAtMs` local variable feeds both the frontmatter splice AND the `daily_pieces` INSERT binding — the two sources of truth agree to the millisecond.

3. **Homepage + library sort** switches from `b.data.date.localeCompare(a.data.date)` to a two-step comparator: date DESC, then `publishedAt` DESC tiebreaker. At 1 piece/day the tiebreaker never fires; at multi-per-day it gives deterministic newest-first ordering. Applied to [`src/pages/index.astro`](../src/pages/index.astro), [`src/pages/daily/index.astro`](../src/pages/daily/index.astro), [`src/pages/library/index.astro`](../src/pages/library/index.astro).

4. **Admin "View on site" link** ([`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro:346)) updated to use `pieceUrl(date, deriveSlug(entry.id))`. The admin page is server-rendered (`prerender = false`) so a fresh `getCollection('dailyPieces')` call at request time finds the matching entry by date. At multi-per-day cadence the current code picks the first match — admin surface itself still keyed by date, pending Phase 5 rework when the interval flips.

**Why derive slug from `entry.id` instead of a frontmatter `slug` field.** The slug is already determined by the filename convention Director writes at publish time. Adding an explicit `slug` frontmatter field would be duplication with drift risk: if Drafter and the filename fall out of sync, which wins? Derivation from `entry.id` makes the filename authoritative. Future slug-refinement work (e.g., short-slug Phase 7 item) can add an override field without changing today's derivation.

**Why no 301 redirect for the 5 legacy URLs.** Per Zishan, dev phase, 5 pieces, no bookmarks. Adding a redirect worker-route would be real infrastructure for a concern we don't have. The 5 legacy URLs (`/daily/2026-04-17/` through `/daily/2026-04-21/`) return 404 after this deploy.

**Why add `publishedAt` to frontmatter instead of joining D1 at build time.** Astro static-site generation runs at build time, not request time. The site worker has a D1 binding but it's a request-time resource — build-time code can't reach it. Frontmatter is the only build-time source of truth for sort order. Cost: one line per MDX file, written automatically by Director going forward.

**Build verification:** `pnpm build` produces all 5 pages at the new URL shape: `/daily/2026-04-21/trump-administration-begins-refunding-more-than-166bn-in-tar/index.html` and the other four. Homepage + library + /library/ + 404 all build. Server-entry bundle unchanged.

**Preview verification (localhost:4321):**
- Homepage loads, hero title is "Who Really Pays Tariffs? The $166 Billion Answer" (newest piece by `publishedAt`).
- Recent list shows 4 other pieces, all linking to the new nested URL shape.
- `/daily/2026-04-21/trump-administration-…/` renders the piece with 6 beats + audio player + Zita chat.
- `/library/` returns 200.
- Old-shape URL `/daily/2026-04-21/` returns 404 (no redirect, as designed).
- Zero console errors.

**Non-goals for Phase 4:**
- No changes to `/api/daily/[date]/made` endpoint (still date-keyed — serves the made-drawer, which fetches by date and works fine at 1 piece/day). Phase 5 or 6 adds piece_id filtering if admin flips to multi-per-day.
- No changes to the admin `/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/` route shape — admin URL stays date-keyed. Phase 5 rework for multi-per-day.
- No slug frontmatter field. Slug is derived from filename, authoritative source stays single.
- No short-slug / seo-slug refinement. The existing truncation-at-60 output from Director (filename-encoded) carries forward verbatim. Phase 7 cleanup if we ever want prettier URLs for legacy pieces.
- No Drafter prompt change to emit `publishedAt` — Director splices it at publish time, same pattern as `voiceScore`.
- No reader-visible "multi-piece today" UI. Until admin flips `interval_hours` below 24, the reader experience is visually identical to before.

## 2026-04-21: Multi-piece cadence — Phase 3 hourly cron + runtime gate (minimal)

**Context:** Phase 3 of the cadence plan. The behavioural phase — changes the cron from `'0 2 * * *'` to `'0 * * * *'` and teaches `dailyRun` to gate on `admin_settings.interval_hours` (Phase 2's plumbing) so only the right hour slots fire the pipeline. With `interval_hours=24` (the default seeded value) only the 02:00 UTC slot fires, reproducing today's 1-piece/day behaviour exactly. Flipping to `4` (testing) or `1` (production) becomes a `wrangler d1 execute --remote` one-liner that takes effect on the next hour boundary, no redeploy.

**Decision: minimal Phase 3.** No new migration. No new column on `pipeline_log`. No changes to per-piece filter semantics anywhere. Three focused edits:

1. **Cron switch.** `onStart` creates a cron at `'0 * * * *'` instead of `'0 2 * * *'`. The old row persists in SQLite until we cancel it — see point 3.

2. **Runtime gate inside `dailyRun`.** At the top of the handler, read `interval_hours` via [`getAdminSetting`](../agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts) (Phase 2), compute `currentHour = new Date().getUTCHours()`, and bail out when `(currentHour - 2 + 24) % intervalHours !== 0`. The `-2` anchors the fire slot to hour 2 UTC so the current 02:00 ritual is preserved at every allowed interval (1/2/3/4/6/8/12/24 — all divisors of 24). The bail is silent — no observer log, no pipeline_log row, no work. The DO wakes, runs the gate in ~1ms, returns.

3. **One-time cancel of legacy `'0 2 * * *'` row.** Also at the top of `dailyRun`, after the gate (so it doesn't waste time on skipped hours): call `getSchedules({ callback: 'dailyRun' })`, iterate, and `cancelSchedule(id)` any row whose cron is `'0 2 * * *'`. Idempotent — once deleted, subsequent calls return `false` from cancelSchedule. Runs on every un-gated handler invocation; cleans up automatically on the first post-deploy hourly firing.

**Why cancel from `dailyRun`, not from `onStart`.** The documented hazard at [director.ts:46-55](../agents/src/director.ts#L46-L55) is that `super.alarm()` triggers `onStart` BEFORE the SDK scans the schedule table for due rows. If `onStart` cancels the currently-firing schedule row, the SDK loses track of the alarm and silently swallows the run. Cancelling from inside the callback itself (`dailyRun`) is safe: by then the alarm has already been dispatched and the cron row has already been re-scheduled by the SDK. Verified against the SDK source at `agents/node_modules/agents/dist/index.js:1658-1669` — `cancelSchedule(id)` is idempotent (returns `false` when the row is already gone) so the cleanup loop is safe to run on every invocation.

**Order of operations matters, and it's naturally correct:**
1. DO spins up after deploy. `onStart` runs → creates the new `'0 * * * *'` row (SDK is idempotent on `(callback, cron, payload)` so it's a single row, not a duplicate).
2. Old `'0 2 * * *'` row still exists. Both schedules are live.
3. Whichever fires first — hourly or daily — triggers `dailyRun`.
4. `dailyRun` top: gate check (skip if wrong hour), then cancel the legacy row.
5. After step 4 has run once, only the hourly cron exists. Future runs skip the cancel loop (idempotent no-op).

No window where the new cron is missing. No race against an in-flight alarm.

**`pipeline_log.run_id` stays as `YYYY-MM-DD` permanently.** This is the second time in this session a Phase tried to shift run_id to piece_id; both walked back. The reasoning for this final position — stable going forward — is:

(a) **Regression on 2026-04-21 showed the consequence of changing it.** Earlier today the backfill broke the "How this was made" drawer on every daily-piece page plus the admin per-piece deep-dive timeline + the admin live-pipeline poller + the dashboard's isRunningNow indicator. Four consumer sites had embedded `run_id = YYYY-MM-DD` assumption. The snapshot (`pipeline_log_backup_20260421`) restored the column. See DECISIONS 2026-04-21 "Roll back `pipeline_log.run_id` backfill" for the full post-mortem and the guardrail.

(b) **Day-grouping is a legitimate view at multi-per-day.** "Today's pipeline activity" is a real and likely-wanted admin surface — `WHERE run_id = today` returning ALL of today's runs' steps is a feature, not a bug. The admin dashboard already expects this shape (lifetime-runs counter, last-step-per-run-id grid). Forcing run_id to be piece-scoped would require a second column anyway for the day view, so having them separate is not a loss — it's a clean separation of "calendar day" from "piece identity."

(c) **No concrete consumer needs per-piece pipeline_log filtering yet.** Phase 4 will move URLs to `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/slug/` — the URL carries piece context via slug, and per-piece surfaces (made drawer, admin deep-dive) can look up the piece's own id via `daily_pieces WHERE date=? AND slug=?` when they eventually need a finer filter. Adding a `pipeline_log.piece_id` column today would be speculative API for an unbuilt consumer. Phase 4 or Phase 6 can add it when a real need emerges, with site-worker query updates in the same atomic commit (the guardrail from the rollback).

**Audit of all `pipeline_log` consumers (confirmation that each tolerates `run_id = YYYY-MM-DD` through Phase 3 with `interval_hours=24`):**

| File | Query shape | 1/day (today) | Multi/day verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/pages/api/daily/[date]/made.ts:87` | `WHERE run_id = ? bind(date)` | ✓ | Pools all pieces' steps for date — acceptable "day view", revisit at flip |
| `src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro:120` | `WHERE run_id = ? bind(date)` | ✓ | Same — admin sees day-grouped timeline |
| `src/pages/api/dashboard/pipeline.ts:16` | `WHERE run_id = ? bind(today)` | ✓ | Correct — "today's pipeline activity" is the right semantic |
| `src/pages/dashboard/index.astro:165-171` | Last row globally, `isRunningNow = run_id === today` | ✓ | Still string-equal at today's date |
| `src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro:116-141` | `COUNT(DISTINCT run_id)`, last-step-per-run-id | ✓ | Counts days-run not runs-run at multi/day — cosmetic undercount, not broken |
| `agents/src/director.ts:109` | `DELETE WHERE run_id = ? bind(today)` | ✓ clears stale intra-day | ⚠ at multi/day wipes earlier runs' logs — follow-up for flip |
| `agents/src/director.ts:715-717` | `WHERE run_id = ? AND step='publishing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1 bind(date)` | ✓ | Picks latest piece's publishing row — acceptable "retry latest" |
| `agents/src/director.ts:783` | `DELETE WHERE run_id = ? AND step LIKE 'audio%' bind(date)` | ✓ | At multi/day wipes audio logs across day's pieces — retry-fresh semantic |
| `agents/src/director.ts:872` | `INSERT (…, run_id=today, …)` | ✓ writes date | ✓ correct per revised arch |
| `agents/src/learner.ts:338` | `WHERE run_id = ? bind(date)` | ✓ | Synthesis input pools day's pipeline steps — noisy at multi/day, Phase 6 problem |
| `scripts/reset-today.sh:68` | `DELETE WHERE run_id = '$DATE'` | ✓ | "Reset today" = wipe day. Correct at every cadence |

Phase 3 ships with `interval_hours=24` (default) so zero consumer is exercised at multi-per-day. Flipping the interval exposes two real issues flagged above (`director.ts:109` pre-run DELETE, `director.ts:783` audio DELETE, `learner.ts:338` synthesis input scope) — listed as a FOLLOWUP "Unblock multi-per-day: pre-run DELETEs + Learner input scoping" with the flip blocked until it's resolved.

**Non-goals for Phase 3:**
- No new migration.
- No new column on `pipeline_log`.
- No changes to any site-worker or agent query. Consumers stay as-is.
- No admin UI. Flipping the interval is a `wrangler` command.
- No fix for the `director.ts:109` pre-run DELETE at multi-per-day — logged as a FOLLOWUP that blocks the flip.
- No Zita-synthesis-timing shift (Phase 6). At `interval_hours=24` it's still scheduled at 01:45 UTC day+1 absolute-clock and works fine.
- No renaming of `dailyRun` → `hourlyRun`. The method-name-is-callback-string coupling means renaming requires a schedule-table migration; not worth the complexity for a semantic rename. Comment in code explains the current semantics.

**Verification contract for the next cron fire:**
- At 02:00 UTC (the current ritual slot), the hourly cron fires → `dailyRun` runs → gate passes (`(2-2+24)%24 === 0`) → pipeline runs → piece publishes as usual → legacy `'0 2 * * *'` row canceled.
- At 03:00 UTC → hourly cron fires → `dailyRun` runs → gate fails (`(3-2+24)%24 === 1`) → silent bail.
- Repeat at 04:00, 05:00 … 01:00 — all silent bails.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cf_agents_schedules WHERE callback = 'dailyRun'` returns 1 (not 2) after the first 02:00 fire.
- `SELECT data FROM pipeline_log WHERE step = 'scanning' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1` returns JSON with `intervalHours: 24` (Phase 2's read path still working).

## 2026-04-21: Roll back `pipeline_log.run_id` backfill — revert decision #3 from cadence Phase 1

**Context:** Phase 1's manual backfill (documented earlier in today's entry "Multi-piece cadence — Phase 1 identity foundations") rewrote all 111 historical `pipeline_log.run_id` values from `YYYY-MM-DD` date-strings to `daily_pieces.id` UUIDs, on the stated architectural principle that `run_id = piece_id` simplifies joins. The principle is correct in isolation; the mistake was not auditing site-worker consumers before landing the destructive UPDATE.

**What broke.** Two reader-visible surfaces + one admin surface had date-shape `run_id` assumed in their queries:

- [`src/pages/api/daily/[date]/made.ts:87`](../src/pages/api/daily/[date]/made.ts) — `SELECT ... FROM pipeline_log WHERE run_id = ?` `.bind(date)`. Powers the "How this was made" drawer on every public daily-piece page. Returned zero rows post-backfill — timeline section on /daily/2026-04-17 through /daily/2026-04-21 was empty for several hours 2026-04-21 afternoon.
- [`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro:120`](../src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro) — same query shape. Admin per-piece deep-dive pipeline section empty.
- [`src/pages/dashboard/index.astro:165-171`](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro) — `isRunningNow = lastStep.run_id === today && !terminal`. With UUID run_ids, the string-equality check against `today` (YYYY-MM-DD) was always false. Live-pipeline indicator on public dashboard would not activate during the next 2am run.
- [`src/pages/api/dashboard/pipeline.ts:16`](../src/pages/api/dashboard/pipeline.ts) — same pattern, powering admin live polling. Admin live-pipeline feed would have been empty on the next cron fire.

**Decision:** Roll back the destructive UPDATE via the `pipeline_log_backup_20260421` snapshot and walk back Phase 1 decision #3 (`run_id = piece_id`). `pipeline_log.run_id` stays `YYYY-MM-DD` permanently — the column is semantically "which calendar day does this step belong to," distinct from "which piece." Phase 3 will add a separate **`pipeline_log.piece_id` column** for per-piece filtering at multi-per-day cadence; both columns coexist.

Rollback ran 2026-04-21 via `wrangler d1 execute --remote`:
```sql
DELETE FROM pipeline_log;
INSERT INTO pipeline_log SELECT * FROM pipeline_log_backup_20260421;
```
All 111 rows restored to date-shape run_ids with step counts intact (31/23/19/19/19). Local D1 reverse-migrated via `UPDATE run_id = (SELECT date FROM daily_pieces WHERE id = run_id)` — local didn't have the snapshot because I only ran the backup on remote in Phase 1.

**Why decision #3 was wrong.** The "simpler joins" argument ignored that the existing 5 site-worker consumers had already embedded the `run_id=date` convention. At 1 piece/day, `WHERE run_id = ?` with either a date or piece_id works equivalently (one row per day either way). The semantic split — calendar day vs piece identity — only matters at multi-per-day. At that cadence, we need both: a column for "all steps from today's runs" (run_id stays date) and a column for "all steps from THIS piece's run" (piece_id). Forcing them into one column was YAGNI in reverse — collapsing two future concepts prematurely.

**Revised architecture (supersedes Phase 1 decision #3):**
- `pipeline_log.run_id` = `YYYY-MM-DD`, unchanged from launch. One date may have multiple runs at multi-per-day — acceptable; the column represents the day, not the run.
- `pipeline_log.piece_id` — new nullable TEXT column added in Phase 3. Links to `daily_pieces.id`. Per-piece queries (`made.ts`, admin deep-dive) switch from `WHERE run_id = <date>` to `WHERE piece_id = <uuid>` (via a small lookup). Cross-day queries keep using run_id.
- At Phase 3 deploy, the code+schema change is atomic: migration adds `piece_id` column + backfills historical 5-row data + site-worker queries are updated in the same commit. No interim broken state.

**Guardrail for future destructive data migrations.** Before any UPDATE that rewrites values in a shared column, `grep` the full repo for usages of that column with string-literal or parameter-bound comparisons against the OLD shape. The Phase 1 oversight was: running `grep run_id` would have surfaced the 4 consumer sites and caught the assumption. Pattern to add to the runbook's migration hygiene section.

**Backup table disposition.** `pipeline_log_backup_20260421` was already queued for drop on 2026-04-28 in FOLLOWUPS. The entry text updates to note the snapshot served its purpose — consumed for this rollback on 2026-04-21 — with the drop date unchanged. The snapshot can still be useful for a second-attempt audit before Phase 3 touches the column.

**Non-goals:**
- No revert of Phase 1's other backfills (`audit_results`, `learnings`, `zita_messages` piece_id columns — those are additive and don't break any reader). Those stay.
- No edits to the already-applied migration 0014 SQL (it ran, it's part of history). A prominent warning comment is added to the file's pipeline_log backfill block pointing to this DECISIONS entry so a future replay doesn't re-break the site.
- No production piece re-publish or reader-visible apology. The broken window was ~4 hours on a new launch week; reader traffic is low; the drawer's timeline section empty-state is inert (no error, just empty). Not worth narrating.

## 2026-04-21: Multi-piece cadence — Phase 2 admin_settings plumbing

**Context:** Phase 1 of the cadence plan (earlier this session) laid the identity foundations — piece_id FKs across child tables, audio PK rebuild, pipeline_log.run_id semantic shift. Phase 2 is the second atomic deliverable: the `admin_settings` table that will eventually hold all admin-configurable system state, seeded with the cadence value Phase 3 will gate on. Plan §6 Phase 2 scope is explicit: no behavioural change, just the table + a Director read path that proves the plumbing works.

**Decision:** One migration + one helper + one four-line Director change.

1. **Migration 0016** creates `admin_settings(key TEXT PK, value TEXT NOT NULL, updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL)` and seeds `interval_hours='24'`. Stringly-typed values (application layer parses to whatever the caller wants) is deliberate — future settings like rate limits, feature flags, or voice overrides don't need schema migrations to land, just a new key. `INSERT OR IGNORE` on the seed so a replay doesn't stomp a later admin edit.

2. **New helper** [agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts](../agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts): `getAdminSetting<T>(db, key, parse, fallback)`. Catches every failure mode (missing row, null value, non-string value, DB throw) and returns `fallback`. This is deliberate — `admin_settings` is an operational config surface, never a source-of-truth for pipeline identity, so every consumer must have a safe default that preserves current behaviour. Not cached; each call hits D1. At Director's once-per-run cadence the SELECT is ~1ms and the fresh-read semantics mean an admin UI change propagates on the next run without a DO restart.

3. **Director read path** ([agents/src/director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts)) inside `triggerDailyPiece`, after the dedup clear and before the scanner phase. The read stores `intervalHours` in a local variable and passes it into the existing `scanning` step's `data` field — visibility in the admin pipeline feed confirms the read path works, without adding new observer events or noise. The value is otherwise unused in Phase 2; Phase 3 wires it into the hourly gate.

**Why `ALLOWED_INTERVAL_HOURS = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]`.** Must be divisors of 24 so the hour-2-anchored modulo gate (Phase 3) produces a consistent daily rhythm. Non-divisors drift across days: a 5-hour interval would fire at 02/07/12/17/22 UTC on day 1, then 03/08/13/18/23 on day 2 — the daily rhythm rotates. Every divisor of 24 gives a stable repeating slot pattern. `parseIntervalHours()` enforces this defensively — a manual D1 edit setting `value='5'` falls back to 24, preserving production cadence instead of landing a broken rhythm. The admin UI (Phase 5) will constrain the dropdown to the allowed set; the parser is the second line of defence.

**Why read inside `triggerDailyPiece`, not `onStart`.** Plan §6 Phase 2 lists "Director reads interval_hours on onStart and on each alarm firing." The `onStart` half would be harmless in Phase 2 (reading is not writing, so the cancel-from-onStart hazard at [director.ts:46-55](../agents/src/director.ts) doesn't apply), but it'd read on every DO spin-up — not tied to a specific cron firing — and do nothing with the value. Reading inside `triggerDailyPiece` ties the read to the run it could affect. Cleaner. Phase 3's hourly gate will live here too.

**Fallback posture: 24 everywhere.** If the row is missing, the value is malformed, the DB throws, or `parseIntervalHours` rejects the value, the read returns 24. Defensive layers:
- Migration seeds `interval_hours='24'`.
- Helper returns `fallback` on any error.
- Parser falls back to 24 on non-divisor / non-numeric input.
- Director passes `24` as the `fallback` argument.

Production cadence stays 1/day through any of those failure paths.

**Verified locally:** migration 0016 applied to local D1 via `wrangler d1 execute --local --file`; `SELECT * FROM admin_settings` returns the single seeded row with `interval_hours='24'`. Agents TypeScript check clean on both touched files (18 pre-existing SubAgent typing errors in `server.ts` unchanged from Phase 1, zero errors in `director.ts` or `admin-settings.ts`).

**Verified remote:** migration 0016 applied via `wrangler d1 migrations apply --remote`; tracker at 0016; seed row present. Director code change lands on the next push + CI deploy, ready for tonight's 02:00 UTC cron to smoke-check the read path.

**Non-goals for Phase 2 (explicit):**
- No admin UI — that's Phase 5.
- No gating on the read value — that's Phase 3.
- No `admin_settings_changed` observer event yet — introduced with the write path in Phase 5.
- No caching in the helper — fresh read per call keeps the "admin change → next run" propagation story clean.
- No separate admin_settings reader for the site worker. When Phase 5 adds the write path, it'll either import this helper directly (if the site worker has a D1 binding) or hit the agents worker via the existing admin RPC. Decide then, not now.

**Post-apply verification contract for tonight's 2am UTC run:**
- `SELECT data FROM pipeline_log WHERE step = 'scanning' AND created_at > <now> ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1` returns JSON with `intervalHours: 24`.
- Piece lands as usual (no behavioural change).
- Observer feed shows no new error categories.

## 2026-04-21: Multi-piece cadence — Phase 1 identity foundations

**Context:** The site currently publishes 1 piece/day at 02:00 UTC — baked in as both schema and semantics at ~50 sites across the codebase. The goal is admin-configurable cadence: testing at 1 piece every 4 hours (6/day), production at 1 piece every 1 hour (24/day). Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/could-please-do-a-harmonic-waffle.md`. This entry records the 10 architectural decisions that unblock the rest of the cadence plan, plus the Phase 1 schema work that makes multi-per-day non-colliding without changing any runtime behaviour yet.

**The 10 decisions (plan §5):**

1. **URL structure: `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/slug/`** (nested). The alternative flat `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-slug/` put a timestamp in the URL with no reader value; the UUID option was unshareable; the sequence-number option had no meaning for readers. Nested is clean, shareable, and groups naturally by day.
2. **Unique identifier: `piece_id` = `daily_pieces.id` (existing UUID).** Audit on 2026-04-21 confirmed all 5 prod rows are UUIDs generated via `crypto.randomUUID()` at [director.ts:286](../agents/src/director.ts#L286). Adding a separate `piece_id` column would have been duplication. The `date` column stays alongside `id` as the calendar/display key.
3. **`run_id` shape: `run_id = piece_id`.** Literally the same value — `pipeline_log.run_id` holds the piece's UUID, not a calendar date. Joins to `daily_pieces.id` directly without translation.
4. **Scheduling: hourly cron (`0 * * * *`) + runtime gate** on `admin_settings.interval_hours`. Anchor the fire slot to hour 2 UTC so the current 02:00 ritual is preserved at any interval: `if ((hour - 2 + 24) % intervalHours !== 0) skip;`. Interval choices constrained to divisors of 24 — {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24} — so the rhythm repeats each day cleanly. Non-divisors would create drift across days. Dynamic cron re-scheduling (Option C in the plan) rejected due to the cancel-from-onStart hazard documented at [director.ts:46-55](../agents/src/director.ts#L46-L55); static crons rejected because they require a redeploy per interval change.
5. **Homepage hero: most-recent by `published_at DESC`.** Tiebreaker required because multiple pieces can share a `date`. Preserves the factory-floor aesthetic (the page responds to the pipeline) over an admin-pinned hero.
6. **Library: flat newest-first (current shape).** Grouping by day with date headers becomes necessary around 6-8 pieces/day; not designing for 24/day yet. Same `published_at DESC` tiebreaker.
7. **Zita synthesis: `publish + 23h45m`** relative delay per piece, plus `zita_messages.piece_id` column added this phase (not deferred). Absolute 01:45 UTC day+1 breaks when N pieces publish per day (all N synth jobs stack on one clock). Piece-id scoping is the same fix as the Phase 1 Zita plan's piece_date addition, one level deeper — at multi-per-day the `piece_date` column pools conversations from different pieces sharing a date.
8. **Scanner/Curator: 6 feeds / 50 cap sufficient at 4/day, revisit at 24/day.** Sequential Curator (re-use existing code, one pick per run); a run that finds no teachable story is a valid no-op, not a failure. Add: pass **today's prior picks** into Curator's `recentPieces` input so it doesn't re-select. Today's traffic at 4/day lands ~60-80 candidates per day after URL dedup; 24/day pushes the selection rate to ~16% and may need more feeds.
9. **Copy: keep "daily".** Refers to reader rhythm, not publish rate. Readers can still have a daily read even when the system publishes 24×/day.
10. **Config home: D1 `admin_settings` table + `/api/dashboard/admin/settings` endpoint.** Env-var alternative would mean a redeploy per cadence change — friction this plan cannot afford while testing. Every admin mutation fires an `admin_settings_changed` observer_event (audit trail).

**Refinement 1 — no 301 redirect for old `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` URLs.** Per Zishan 2026-04-21: dev phase, 5 pieces, no bookmarks. Old URLs stop existing when Phase 4 ships; no redirect layer.

**Refinement 3 — `zita_messages` gets `piece_id` in Phase 1, not deferred.** Same argument as the decision text above for #7.

**Why piece_id and not a new column like `piece_uuid`.** Every INSERT path in the agents worker already calls `crypto.randomUUID()` for the daily_pieces.id. Six existing writer sites ([director.ts](../agents/src/director.ts), [observer.ts](../agents/src/observer.ts), [scanner.ts](../agents/src/scanner.ts), [shared/learnings.ts](../agents/src/shared/learnings.ts)) generate UUIDs today. The PK on daily_pieces is `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`, already unique, already stable. Introducing a parallel `piece_id TEXT UNIQUE` would have forced every query and every writer to choose between two equivalent keys. Reuse is the simpler, less-error-prone choice — at the small cost that the semantic name "piece_id" now lives in application-code comments and child-table FK column names, not on the parent table.

**Phase 1 shipping artifacts (this commit):**
- [migrations/0014_piece_id_fks.sql](../migrations/0014_piece_id_fks.sql) — add nullable `piece_id TEXT` column + index to `audit_results`, `learnings`, `zita_messages`, `daily_candidates`. Auto-applied ALTERs; backfill UPDATEs commented for manual `wrangler d1 execute` runs. Includes `pipeline_log.run_id` backfill (no schema change, just `UPDATE run_id = daily_pieces.id WHERE run_id = daily_pieces.date`).
- [migrations/0015_daily_piece_audio_piece_id_pk.sql](../migrations/0015_daily_piece_audio_piece_id_pk.sql) — PK rebuild. Old table's composite PK `(date, beat_name)` cannot tolerate multi-per-day. Snapshot-first (`daily_piece_audio_backup_20260421`, same pattern as Zita Phase 1's `zita_messages_backup_20260421`), create new table with PK `(piece_id, beat_name)`, copy rows joining piece_id via `daily_pieces.date`, drop old, rename new. Auto-applied. 32 rows across 5 dates — snapshot is free insurance.
- This DECISIONS entry.
- No code changes in Phase 1. Director, auditors, Publisher all keep passing `date` as today. After the backfill lands, every historical row has piece_id, and Phase 2 / Phase 3 start writing piece_id on new rows without breaking existing callers.

**Hazards addressed:**
- **Cancel-from-onStart swallow** — Option A (hourly cron + gate) picked for decision #4 so onStart never re-schedules; the cron stays `0 * * * *` regardless of admin-settings value.
- **Zita synthesis absolute-clock collision** — decision #7 uses per-piece relative delay so N pieces generate N independent synthesis targets.
- **run_id collision at multi-per-day** — decision #3 + migration 0014's run_id backfill eliminates it before Phase 3 starts writing multi-per-day.
- **Audio PK collision at multi-per-day** — migration 0015 rebuilds the PK before Phase 3.

**Deferred to later phases:**
- **Phase 2:** `admin_settings` table + Director reads config (no UI yet).
- **Phase 3:** cron switches from `0 2 * * *` to `0 * * * *` + runtime gate + multi-per-day dedup. Adds a new slug column to `daily_pieces` at this point since the URL change needs it.
- **Phase 4:** URL routing `/daily/[date]/[slug]/`, homepage + library tiebreaker, per-piece admin route shift, content-collection filename + frontmatter convention.
- **Phase 5:** Admin settings UI.
- **Phase 6:** Zita synthesis re-scoping to piece_id (uses the column added in Phase 1), Scanner/Curator retune, "days running" rename, reset-today flag.
- **Phase 7:** Copy + docs.

**Non-goals for Phase 1 (explicit):**
- No schema change to `pipeline_log` (the `run_id` column stays TEXT; only the values migrate).
- No 301 redirect layer for old URLs (decision above).
- No `piece_id` backfill for `daily_candidates` — prod has 250 rows across 5 dates with **zero `selected=1`** (historical data-flow quirk where the post-curator UPDATE apparently didn't land; separate investigation). New runs write piece_id going forward.
- No frontmatter edits to the 5 existing MDX files in this phase. Phase 4's URL work may add slug/publishedAt fields — metadata carve-out applies then, not now.
- No new `admin_settings` table in this phase — Phase 2.

**Verified (pre-apply):**
- `daily_pieces.id` values for all 5 prod rows match the UUID v4 shape (verified via direct D1 query 2026-04-21).
- `daily_piece_audio` rows: 32 total (8+6+6+6+6) across 5 dates, 1:1 with daily_pieces.
- `learnings` rows: 22 across 3 piece_dates — every row's `piece_date` has a matching `daily_pieces.date`.
- `zita_messages` rows: 92 across 4 piece_dates — all from the 2026-04-21 Phase 1 backfill; every piece_date has a matching daily_pieces row.
- `pipeline_log` rows: 111 across 5 run_ids (`'2026-04-17'` … `'2026-04-21'`) — every run_id maps to exactly one daily_pieces row via date.
- `audit_results` rows: 3, all from 2026-04-21 — unambiguous backfill target.

**Post-apply verification (run before declaring Phase 1 done):**
- `PRAGMA table_info(audit_results)` / `learnings` / `zita_messages` / `daily_candidates` — all show `piece_id TEXT` column present.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM daily_piece_audio WHERE piece_id IS NULL` — expect 0.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM learnings WHERE piece_id IS NULL AND piece_date IS NOT NULL` — expect 0 after manual backfill.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM zita_messages WHERE piece_id IS NULL AND piece_date IS NOT NULL` — expect 0 after manual backfill.
- `SELECT run_id, COUNT(*) FROM pipeline_log GROUP BY run_id` — expect 5 UUID run_ids, each matching `daily_pieces.id`.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM daily_piece_audio_backup_20260421` — expect 32.

## 2026-04-21: Dashboard "latest observation" label uses piece_date, not created_at

**Context:** Surfaced the moment the first real `source='zita'` learning landed on prod. The public dashboard ([`/dashboard/`](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro)) shows the most recent observation under "What we've learned so far" with an attribution line: *"— {source label}, after the {date} piece."* The date was derived from `learnings.created_at.toISOString().slice(0, 10)`. For producer and self-reflection sources this is correct because those writers fire seconds after publish — `created_at` and `piece_date` match. For Zita-source rows they diverge: synthesis runs at 01:45 UTC on day+1, so the row is written a calendar day after the piece it's about. Right after the first real Zita synthesis, the dashboard attributed a learning about 2026-04-20's Hormuz piece to "the 2026-04-21 piece" — the date the row was written, not the piece it was about.

**Decision:** Prefer `piece_date` (the piece the learning is ABOUT) over `created_at` (when the row was written), fall back to `created_at.slice(0, 10)` for pre-0012 rows where `piece_date` is NULL. One-line change in [`src/pages/dashboard/index.astro`](../src/pages/dashboard/index.astro): pull `piece_date` in the `latestLearning` SELECT; derive `latestLearningDate = latestLearning.piece_date ?? created_at-as-date`.

**Why it matters.** The whole point of the public dashboard's memory panel is *"what did the system learn from the thing you're about to read"*. Tying the attribution to the writing timestamp instead of the piece timestamp breaks that compact — especially as more zita-source rows land (they always attribute wrong because synthesis always runs day+1).

**Verified locally:** seeded a test learning with `piece_date='2026-04-20'` and `created_at=now()` (today = 2026-04-21). Before fix: dashboard showed "after the 2026-04-21 piece". After fix: "after the 2026-04-20 piece". Test row cleaned before commit.

## 2026-04-21: P1.5 Learner skeleton — Zita-question synthesis scheduled 01:45 UTC day+1 (Phase 5)

**Context:** Phase 5 of the Zita improvement plan and P1.5 from the 2026-04-19 improvement plan. Schema plumbing for `source='zita'` has been in place since migration 0011 (2026-04-20), labels in the made-drawer and public dashboard have referenced it since 2026-04-20 commit [a0a9b22](https://github.com/zzeeshann/zeemish-v2/commit/a0a9b22), but no code path wrote rows with that source. CLAUDE.md has flagged it as "blocked on reader + Zita traffic" — but waiting for real data to arrive before building the synthesis means we'd be writing the synthesis on the day the first real signal appeared, under time pressure. Better to build the skeleton now, guarded so it no-ops cleanly at current traffic levels, and let it start producing rows organically as reader traffic grows.

**Decision:** Mirror the three-source pattern exactly.

1. **New prompt** `LEARNER_ZITA_PROMPT` in [`agents/src/learner-prompt.ts`](../agents/src/learner-prompt.ts). Shape identical to `LEARNER_POST_PUBLISH_PROMPT`: 0–10 learnings, strict JSON, category is voice/structure/fact/engagement, no hedging. Prompt posture is different — it names the Socratic-chat context, asks for pattern-recurrence (not per-conversation summaries), and its example learnings are all recognition-of-misreading / beyond-the-piece-questions / engagement-pattern shaped (not audit-violation shaped).

2. **New Learner method** `analyseZitaPatternsDaily(date)` in [`agents/src/learner.ts`](../agents/src/learner.ts). Pulls `zita_messages WHERE piece_date = ? ORDER BY created_at ASC`, counts user messages, **returns `{ skipped: true, userMsgCount, durationMs }` without firing a Claude call when `userMsgCount < ZITA_SYNTHESIS_MIN_USER_MESSAGES` (5).** Above threshold: pulls the piece's headline + underlying_subject for context, groups messages by reader, builds a compact "### Conversation N (K turns)\\nReader: …\\nZita: …" block per reader, sends to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (max_tokens: 2000, same model as the other two synthesis calls), parses JSON with the existing `extractJson` helper, caps writes at `ZITA_LEARNINGS_WRITE_CAP` (10), writes via `writeLearning(db, category, observation, { date, phase: 'zita-synthesis', readerCount, userMsgCount, totalMsgCount }, 60, 'zita', date)`. Returns `ZitaSynthesisResult { date, skipped, userMsgCount, written, overflowCount, considered, tokensIn, tokensOut, durationMs }` — the last three are for cost metering.

3. **Director scheduling** in [`agents/src/director.ts`](../agents/src/director.ts) `triggerDailyPiece`, after `publishing done`. Unlike producer + self-reflection (which fire at publish+1s because they analyse signals complete at publish), Zita synthesis needs a full day of reader traffic. Schedule for **01:45 UTC on day+1** — just before the 02:00 UTC cron kicks the next run, so we analyse a complete window without interfering. Computed via `Date.UTC(y, m, d+1, 1, 45)` and `Math.max(60, Math.floor(...))`. For a publish at ~02:07 UTC, delay is ~23.63h / 85080s.

4. **New alarm handler** `analyseZitaPatternsScheduled({date, title})` mirrors `analyseProducerSignalsScheduled` shape exactly. Calls `learner.analyseZitaPatternsDaily(date)`, logs via `observer.logZitaSynthesisMetered(...)` (handles both skipped and success paths — the skip log is informational so "is the P1.5 schedule firing?" has a visible answer even when traffic is below threshold), logs via `observer.logZitaSynthesisFailure(...)` on throw. Non-retriable.

5. **Observer methods** in [`agents/src/observer.ts`](../agents/src/observer.ts):
   - `logZitaSynthesisMetered(date, title, metrics)` — branches on `metrics.skipped`. Skipped: `severity: 'info'`, "Zita synthesis skipped: title" / "only N reader messages, threshold 5, no Claude call fired". Success: "Zita synthesis: title" / tokens-in/out + latency + overflow. Both shapes match the existing `logReflectionMetered` posture.
   - `logZitaSynthesisFailure(date, title, reason)` — `severity: 'warn'`, same shape as `logLearnerFailure` and `logReflectionFailure`.

6. **No Drafter changes.** The runtime `getRecentLearnings(db, 10)` in [`agents/src/shared/learnings.ts`](../agents/src/shared/learnings.ts) is source-agnostic — `source='zita'` rows auto-flow into the next Drafter prompt the moment they're written. Zero work needed on the reader side of the loop.

**Why the guard at 5, not 0.** Below 5 user messages, Claude would produce learnings from 1–4 chat turns, which is noise rather than pattern. A pattern by definition requires repetition or a striking exchange; single chats don't qualify. At current traffic (3 users across 5 pieces as of 2026-04-21), most days will skip. That's the right behaviour — we'd rather have `source='zita'` rows appear organically when real signal exists than produce a stream of low-confidence rows that pollute the Drafter's feed. The skip is metered so we know the schedule is running; the count is a leading indicator for when the feature "activates" naturally.

**Why not schedule at publish+1h.** That's what producer + self-reflection do, because they analyse signals complete at publish. Zita synthesis needs reader traffic that takes a day. At publish+1h the ≥5 guard would skip every run (readers haven't arrived yet), and we'd never know if the schedule was firing vs the guard was the problem. Scheduling at 01:45 UTC day+1 means the guard becomes a real threshold instead of a false one.

**Non-retriable by design.** Same reasoning as `analysePiecePostPublish` and `reflect`: the piece is live, one missed synthesis isn't catastrophic, and retry logic turns into mystery failures later. If a run fails, `logZitaSynthesisFailure` warns in the admin feed and the loop moves on.

**Verified locally:** typecheck passes with zero new errors (33 pre-existing SubAgent typing errors before AND after the change). Schedule math verified via a simulated 02:07 UTC publish: target = 01:45 UTC next day, delay = 85080s = 23.63h. Full runtime test (triggering the alarm) would require waiting 24 hours or invoking the scheduled method directly via the agents worker; deferred to Zishan's call on whether to manually trigger against the 2026-04-20 piece's 26 messages (17 user messages, above threshold) to see a real Claude synthesis run.

**Non-goals:**
- No Drafter retuning to weight `source='zita'` differently. They flow into the same 10-row feed as the other sources, equal standing.
- No per-conversation analysis or drill-down UI — the admin Zita view (Phase 3) already provides the raw data; this synthesis is about patterns, not individual sessions.
- No real-time / per-message triggering. One synthesis per piece per day is enough; the schedule boundary is deliberate.
- No cost alerting / escalation on token spike. Metered info event is sufficient until we see actual drift.

## 2026-04-21: Zita safety smallest-viable pass (Phase 4)

**Context:** Phase 4 of the Zita improvement plan. With piece-scoping (Phase 1), a history cap (Phase 2), and admin visibility (Phase 3) in place, three operational blind spots remained:
1. Claude API errors were silently swallowed — the reader saw a generic 503, ops never learned which piece / user / upstream status triggered it.
2. Rate-limit 429s were silently returned — no way to see abuse patterns or runaway clients in the admin feed.
3. The persisted assistant `content` had no ceiling. `max_tokens: 300` at the API level is the only bound, but a misconfigured model / cache weirdness could theoretically return longer output, and a single row could dominate future context loads.

**Decision:** smallest-viable safety pass. No prompt-injection hardening (that's gated on Phase 6's design doc); just the three observable gaps.

1. **`zita_claude_error` observer_event** fired when `!claudeResponse.ok`. Severity `warn` (not `escalation` — Claude is occasionally flaky). Context captures `{ type, httpStatus, userId, pieceDate, upstreamBody }` — the upstream body is capped at 500 chars via `claudeResponse.text().slice(0, 500)` to stop large error payloads from bloating `observer_events`. Reader still sees the generic "Zita is temporarily unavailable" — the event is for ops, not for disclosure.

2. **`zita_rate_limited` observer_event** fired on the 429 path. Severity `warn`. Context `{ type, userId, limit: 20, windowSeconds: 900 }`. Helpful for catching runaway clients or abuse patterns — the current rate limit (20 msg / 15 min) is aggressive, so one spam-loop would produce a clear trail.

3. **`zita_handler_error` observer_event** on the outer `catch` for unhandled exceptions. Same severity/shape posture.

4. **`capStoredContent()` helper** — if `content.length > ZITA_STORED_CONTENT_CAP` (4000), truncate and append `\n\n[…truncated]`. Applied to both user message and assistant reply INSERTs. 4000 is generous relative to the ≈1200-char typical output from `max_tokens: 300` — it's a ceiling, not a target. The truncation marker is recognisable if it shows up in a transcript.

**Why not a new writer helper.** `logObserverEvent` from Phase 2 already encapsulates the INSERT + swallow-errors shape. Four call sites now use it: truncation (Phase 2), rate limit, Claude error, handler error.

**Verified end-to-end** via preview: fired 22 rapid POSTs at `/api/zita/chat`. First 20 returned 503 (local Claude key is invalid → 401 → zita_claude_error row each). Next 2 returned 429 → zita_rate_limited rows. Every row had correctly-shaped title, body, and JSON context. Upstream body (authentication_error / invalid x-api-key / request_id) was captured verbatim up to the 500-char cap. Test rows cleaned before commit.

**Non-goals (all deferred to Phase 6 design doc):**
- Prompt-injection detection or guardrails on reader input.
- PII redaction on stored content.
- Per-event alerting (escalation escalation vs. silent warn). Current posture: log everything, let the admin feed show operators what's happening.
- Encryption at rest for `zita_messages` content.

## 2026-04-21: Admin Zita view (Phase 3)

**Context:** Phase 3 of the Zita improvement plan. With Phase 1 scoping `zita_messages` by piece_date and Phase 2 logging truncation events, the next gap was operator visibility: no dashboard surface for reading what readers actually ask Zita. Without this, validating P1.5 (Phase 5's Learner synthesis) is impossible — you can't evaluate whether the synthesised patterns are accurate against reader questions you can't see.

**Decision:** Two surfaces, both admin-gated, matching the existing design system (eyebrow + title header, stat grid, rounded-xl cards with `border-zee-border`, `text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-zee-muted` section headers):

1. **`/dashboard/admin/zita/`** — standalone view. Stats grid (conversations / messages / unique readers / truncation count, all 30-day window). Conversation list grouped by `(user_id, piece_date)`, 100 most recent, each as a `<details>` with collapsed summary (message count, short user id, relative time, piece headline) + expanded transcript (reader/zita labelled messages). Deep-link to per-piece admin route when piece_date is set. Piece headlines joined from `daily_pieces` via a single `WHERE date IN (?, ?, …)` query.

2. **Per-piece deep-dive** (`/dashboard/admin/piece/[date]/`) — new "Questions from readers" section, inserted between Audio and Observer events. Shows distinct readers who chatted about this piece, sorted by most-recent message. Each reader's full transcript expandable via `<details>`. Header includes an "All Zita activity →" link to the standalone view for cross-piece context.

3. **Main admin page entry point** (`/dashboard/admin/`) — new "Zita activity →" link in the top-right corner alongside the existing "← Public dashboard" link.

**Defensive refactor caught during verification:** the per-piece page originally ran audio + zita queries inside the same try/catch. When local D1 was missing `daily_piece_audio` (migration 0010 tracker drift), the audio query threw, the shared catch swallowed it, and the Zita section silently disappeared. Split Zita into its own `try { ... } catch {}` so a failure in an unrelated section can't hide the Questions block. Same defensive shape as the site-worker `logObserverEvent` helper — observability writes never break the handler that's calling them.

**No new data flows.** All three surfaces read from existing tables (`zita_messages`, `daily_pieces`, `observer_events`) — no schema changes, no writer changes. The piece title join uses a fresh `daily_pieces` lookup rather than denormalising into `zita_messages`; 100 conversations × 5 distinct piece_dates in the 30-day window means the `IN (…)` lookup is cheap.

**Verified end-to-end** in local preview with a minimal seeded conversation (4 messages from `demo-reader-1` about the 2026-04-20 piece): stats rendered correctly (1 conv / 4 msgs / 1 reader / 0 truncations), conversation card showed message count + short user id + piece headline, transcript expanded cleanly with READER / ZITA labels and alternating styling. Per-piece deep-dive showed the matching "Questions from readers" block. Test data cleaned before commit.

**Non-goals:**
- No pagination beyond the 100-conversation cap. If the dataset grows, revisit then — not now.
- No filtering UI (search, date-range, reader-id lookup). The deep-links + piece deep-dive give piece-scoped views already; freeform search is Phase 6 territory.
- No PII redaction of content. Messages display verbatim for honest operator review. When the design doc in Phase 6 decides on PII posture, apply it here.
- No real-time refresh. A reload picks up new conversations; the admin surface isn't a live monitoring tool.

## 2026-04-21: Cap Zita history load at 40 + log truncation to observer_events

**Context:** Phase 2 of the Zita improvement plan. Even with Phase 1's piece-scoped history (DECISIONS 2026-04-21 "Scope zita_messages by piece_date"), a single reader's long session on one piece still grows unbounded. In the 92-row audit on 2026-04-21, one user had 44 messages scoped to the 2026-04-21 tariffs piece alone; at current rate, a committed reader could reach 100+ turns on a single day's piece inside a week. Every new message would reload the full history into the Claude system prompt, growing input tokens linearly per turn.

**Decision:** Cap the history load at **40 rows = 20 turns** (user + assistant pairs). Change:

- `SELECT role, content FROM zita_messages WHERE … ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 40` — newest first for correct truncation semantics. Reverse in-memory when building the Claude `messages` array to preserve chronological order.
- Parallel `SELECT COUNT(*)` on the same scope, batched together via `db.batch` so it's one D1 round trip.
- When `totalCount > 40`, fire a `logObserverEvent(db, { severity: 'info', title: 'Zita history truncated at 40 for <pieceDate>', body: 'Clipped N older messages…', context: { type: 'zita_history_truncated', userId, pieceDate, courseSlug, lessonNumber, totalCount, loadedCount: 40, clippedCount: totalCount - 40 } })`. Severity is `info` because this is expected long-session behaviour, not a failure — it surfaces the cap in the admin Observer feed instead of leaving it silent.
- `ZITA_HISTORY_LIMIT` constant at the top of `chat.ts` so a future tweak is a single-line edit.

**Data stays in D1.** The cap is purely about what we send to Claude per turn; `zita_messages` still receives every new INSERT, and the admin Zita view (Phase 3) will read the full history independent of the cap.

**Why 40.** A Socratic exchange is typically short — Zita's prompt enforces 2-4 sentence replies, and reader messages trend short too. 40 rows covers ~20 back-and-forths, which is a long session. Beyond that, older context adds token cost without changing Zita's posture — she's already in-character from the system prompt, not from the conversation. The clippedCount in the observer_event gives us a real signal if 40 turns out to be too aggressive for any reader's flow.

**New helper: `src/lib/observer-events.ts`** — site-worker → `observer_events` writer that mirrors the shape used by `agents/src/observer.ts:writeEvent` (id, severity, title, body, JSON-stringified context, created_at). Fire-and-forget with `try/catch {}` so observer logging never breaks the handler. This is the first site-origin writer of observer_events; Phase 4 will add `zita_claude_error` and `zita_rate_limited` events through the same helper.

**Verified end-to-end locally:** seeded 45 dummy rows for `test-cap-user` on 2026-04-20. `COUNT(*)` returned 45, `LIMIT 40` returned exactly 40 rows. Synthetic `observer_events` INSERT with the same shape the handler produces queried back cleanly with all fields populated. Test data cleaned up before commit.

**Non-goals:**
- No summarisation of clipped messages — they're gone from Claude's view, not condensed into a "previously…" blurb. Add that in Phase 6's deep-Zita design doc if we decide cross-turn memory matters.
- No server-side cursor / pagination UI. The cap is invisible to readers; only visible to admins via observer_events.
- No reduction of the 40 for non-daily courses — lessons-course path keeps the same cap because 20 turns is a reasonable default regardless.

## 2026-04-21: Scope `zita_messages` by piece_date (migration 0013 Commit A)

**Context:** Direct query of `zita_messages` on 2026-04-21 returned 92 rows from 3 users across 5 different daily pieces, all keyed under the same `(course_slug='daily', lesson_number=0)` — because [`LessonLayout.astro:74-78`](../src/layouts/LessonLayout.astro) hardcodes those attributes on `<zita-chat>` for every piece. One reader (User fb906615) had 80 messages spanning QVC → Hormuz → tariffs, all of which loaded into every new Claude call as conversation history. Zita coped verbally ("we've been wandering through the whole lesson") but couldn't prevent cross-piece history contamination or cost creep, and had no way to tell the reader which piece they were on.

**Decision:** Add `zita_messages.piece_date TEXT` (nullable at schema level) + composite index `idx_zita_piece(user_id, piece_date)`. Matches the shape of the `learnings.piece_date` column added in migration 0012 — both are hand-backfilled with a one-time commented UPDATE block inside the migration file, both nullable at schema level so the ALTER applies non-destructively, both enforced non-null at the application layer going forward. This is Commit A of a two-commit Phase 1: schema-only now, code changes (LessonLayout pass-through, request-body field, scoped history SELECT, scoped INSERTs, system-prompt line naming the piece) in Commit B after the migration is applied and verified.

**Two-commit split because:** the 0012 rollout (resolved FOLLOWUPS "D1 migration tracker out of sync") burned an evening recovering from `d1_migrations` drift when code + schema landed together. Separating the commits means: (a) schema change lands, is applied, column existence is verified with a `PRAGMA table_info` query, *then* code starts reading/writing the new column. No "code deployed but column missing" or "column added but code still writing NULL" race window.

**Backfill by content, not by calendar date.** Migration 0012 used `date(created_at/1000, 'unixepoch') = 'YYYY-MM-DD'` to match learnings rows to pieces — works because Learner + Drafter-reflection run within seconds of publish, same calendar day. For Zita messages that pattern fails: readers arrive on their own cadence, and User 5bcf333c's entire conversation about airline jet fuel (2026-04-19 piece) happened on 2026-04-20. Every row was hand-mapped by reading content against the five pieces' headlines. User fb906615 split into three segments by created_at boundaries chosen to fall inside the 55-hour and 21-hour silent gaps between their QVC / Hormuz / tariffs reading sessions. Full mapping, including per-user evidence, lives in [`migrations/0013_zita_messages_piece_date.sql`](../migrations/0013_zita_messages_piece_date.sql) as commented UPDATEs.

**Snapshot before UPDATE.** `CREATE TABLE zita_messages_backup_20260421 AS SELECT * FROM zita_messages;` runs as Step 0 of the backfill — 92-row free rollback, one line, zero downside. Queued for drop on or after 2026-04-28 in FOLLOWUPS once Commit B has been live for a week. Rollback path (if Step 3 distribution is wrong): `DELETE FROM zita_messages; INSERT INTO zita_messages SELECT * FROM zita_messages_backup_20260421;` then revise the mapping.

**Non-goals:**
- No change to the Zita system prompt in this commit. Prompt change ("You are discussing the piece titled …, published …") lives in Commit B, because it reads `piece_date` at request time.
- No deletion of legacy lesson-course conversations. `course_slug='lessons'` rows (if any future path re-enables them) will continue to work with `piece_date=NULL`.
- No backfill of `zita_messages_backup_*` snapshots retroactively for past migrations — this is a one-off safety net for the hand-mapped backfill.

## 2026-04-20: Drop StructureEditor's writeLearning calls

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS 2026-04-20 "StructureEditor writes violation-shaped observations into learnings, not forward-going lessons" flagged that the 2026-04-17 per-piece drawer surfaces raw audit diagnostics ("Hook exceeds one screen - it's two full paragraphs with ~120 words") next to lesson-shaped prose from Learner and Drafter-reflection. The FOLLOWUPS framed two options — (1) retune SE's prompt to emit lesson-shaped prose, or (2) drop SE's writeLearning calls entirely since Learner.analysePiecePostPublish covers the ground from the same source data.

**Investigation (2026-04-20):** Pulled the 4 StructureEditor rows written for 2026-04-17 QVC and the 5 Learner producer rows written for 2026-04-20 Hormuz and compared qualitatively. Three findings:

1. **Learner reads `audit_results` in its post-publish synthesis.** SE's findings are *input* to Learner's generalisation pass — nothing SE sees is invisible to Learner.
2. **SE emits duplicates within a single audit.** 2 of 4 QVC rows said "hook exceeds one screen" — the auditor legitimately flags the same rule break multiple ways, but every flag becomes a separate learnings row. Learner post-publish compresses these into one generalised lesson.
3. **SE's rows teach Drafter rules Drafter already has.** "Lesson has 7 beats instead of the required 3-6 beats" is information the Structure Editor prompt already enforces as a gate. Surfacing it to Drafter via `getRecentLearnings(10)` adds zero signal over the existing voice contract + structure prompt.

Every piece published (including `qualityFlag='low'` ones under the "daily cadence > perfect catalogue" rule) reaches `analysePiecePostPublish`, so the hypothetical "SE catches things for pieces that don't publish" does not translate to any unique coverage in practice.

**Decision:** Option 2. Delete SE's writeLearning calls and the `result.issues`/`result.suggestions` loop. Keep `review()`'s return shape intact — Director and Integrator still use `{passed, issues, suggestions}` to gate publication and drive revision. The `pieceDate` parameter on `review()` (added for the writes on 2026-04-20 via the "Surfacing the learning loop" entry) is removed alongside, since it existed only for the writes we're removing. Director's single call site updated accordingly.

**Historical rows stay in D1.** The 4 QVC rows and any other SE writes on earlier pieces remain in the learnings table as honest historical record. Drafter's `getRecentLearnings(10)` reads newest-first, so they age out naturally as Learner + Drafter-reflection writes accumulate; no cleanup needed.

**Why not Option 1 (prompt retune):**
- Double-duty prompt (audit + lesson-writer) increases cognitive load per call and adds tokens.
- Models synthesise lessons better from the full quality record (post-publish) than from per-violation judgements (audit-time).
- Doesn't solve the within-audit duplicate problem.
- Still wouldn't add signal beyond what Learner already produces.

**What didn't change:**
- SE's audit behaviour — gate scores, issues, suggestions, return shape, Director's consumption. No behavioural change to the pipeline's publication decisions.
- The Structure Editor prompt (`structure-editor-prompt.ts`) — untouched.
- Learner, Drafter-reflect, or any other writer — untouched.
- `writeLearning` helper — still used by Learner.analysePiecePostPublish, Drafter.reflect, and the reader-side Learner path.

## 2026-04-20: Remove /api/dashboard/today — unused since 2026-04-17

**Context:** FOLLOWUPS 2026-04-20 flagged `src/pages/api/dashboard/today.ts` as likely dead. Verification confirmed: zero runtime callers across `src/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`. The public dashboard (`src/pages/dashboard/index.astro`) queries D1 directly in Astro frontmatter; the admin dashboard uses its own client-side fetches against different endpoints; the built worker's `inlinedScripts` contain no reference. The endpoint's last commit (`b84de9e`, 2026-04-17) was itself a comment-only update whose message already named the consumer as gone: *"That path went away when the reader-facing tier moved to voiceScore + src/lib/audit-tier.ts."*

**Decision:** Delete the endpoint. Update RUNBOOK's verify step (line 154) to use a `wrangler d1 execute` query instead of `curl /api/dashboard/today`. Remove the line from RUNBOOK's public API list (line 217). Leave `docs/handoff/ZEEMISH-DASHBOARD-SPEC.md:200` intact — handoff is frozen historical spec. Leave `docs/DECISIONS.md:556` intact — append-only convention; this new entry records the removal without editing the original 2026-04-17 "Soften quality surfacing" reference.

**Chose deletion over keeping for future external consumers.** The FOLLOWUPS investigation hints named the choice explicitly. Speculative API surface rots — three days of zero callers is already long enough that any hypothetical future consumer would be reading stale shape. Better to remove and rebuild against actual demand than maintain a ghost endpoint whose response contract drifts from whatever the dashboard now considers canonical.

**Scope held.** Sibling endpoints (`analytics.ts`, `observer.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `recent.ts`, `stats.ts`) were not audited in this commit — logged as its own FOLLOWUP instead so the sweep can happen deliberately rather than piggybacking on a single-endpoint removal.

**FOLLOWUPS resolved:** 2026-04-20 "/api/dashboard/today.ts appears to be uncalled dead code".
**FOLLOWUPS added:** 2026-04-20 "Audit sibling dashboard API endpoints for the same dead-code pattern".

## 2026-04-20: Surfacing the learning loop (Builds 1 + 2)

**Context:** P1.3 + P1.4 closed the write side of the self-improvement loop on 2026-04-19 — Learner and Drafter now write post-publish learnings. Nothing in the reader-facing UI exposed what was being learned. FOLLOWUPS 2026-04-19 "Surface producer-side learnings + self-reflection in the UI" queued the work pending enough real data to design against. The first real cron run at 2am UTC 2026-04-20 wrote 9 rows on the Hormuz piece (5 producer + 4 self-reflection) — enough density to ship.

**Decision:** Two surfaces, one commit each, sequenced:
- **Build 1 ([b96c8d6](https://github.com/zzeeshann/zeemish-v2/commit/b96c8d6)) — dashboard "What we've learned so far" panel** on `/dashboard/`. Three counts (producer / self-reflection / total) plus the most recent observation as a blockquote with source attribution. New endpoint `/api/dashboard/memory`. Inserted between "How it's holding up" and "The agent team". Quiet visual register matching the rest of the dashboard — no animations, no toggles, no charts.
- **Build 2 ([a0a9b22](https://github.com/zzeeshann/zeemish-v2/commit/a0a9b22)) — per-piece "What the system learned from this piece" section** in the How-this-was-made drawer on `/daily/[date]/`. Grouped by source in fixed order (Drafter self-reflection → Learner producer-side pattern → reader → zita). Hide-when-empty — absent entirely when the piece has no learnings, not just visually hidden. Required migration 0012 adding `learnings.piece_date TEXT`, plus a one-time backfill of 13 pre-migration rows (4 → 2026-04-17 QVC, 9 → 2026-04-20 Hormuz).

Source labels are shared across both surfaces — "Learner, producer-side pattern", "Drafter self-reflection", "Reader signal", "Zita question pattern" — so the vocabulary is stable across dashboard cross-piece view and per-piece drawer view.

**Operational notes:**
- `writeLearning` widened to require `pieceDate` going forward; same defensive non-null pattern as `source` from migration 0011. Both checks route through a shared `logMissingField` helper (renamed from `logSourceRegression` to cover both field warnings).
- Four writer call sites updated: `Learner.analysePiecePostPublish`, `Drafter.reflect`, `StructureEditor.review` (date threaded via one-line Director update since `review()` is stateless over mdx), `Learner.analyseAndLearn` (reader path — pieceDate derived from the daily-piece slug's YYYY-MM-DD prefix with a regex guard; malformed slug skips the write rather than inventing a date).
- Migration 0012's originally-prescribed correlated-subquery backfill (`SET piece_date = (SELECT … ORDER BY ABS(dp.published_at - learnings.created_at) …)`) failed on D1 with "no such column". Rewrote as two date-equality UPDATEs, one per affected piece_date. Same outcome for this data (every learning's `created_at` landed on the same calendar day as its piece's `published_at`) but not the same SQL. Migration file's comment block preserves both shapes for the historical record. See FOLLOWUPS 2026-04-20 "D1 correlated-subquery limitation".
- Migration apply hit a second, unrelated snag: `d1_migrations` was empty (prior migrations applied ad-hoc, bypassing the tracker), so wrangler tried to replay all 12 migrations and failed on 0009's `duplicate column name`. Recovered by manually inserting tracker rows for 0009–0011 and re-running apply — it then applied only 0012. Tracker is now in sync (12 rows, 0001–0012). See FOLLOWUPS 2026-04-20 "D1 migration tracker out of sync".

**Styling register — drawer vs dashboard:**
The drawer runs its own CSS namespace (`src/styles/made.css`, `made-*` prefix, not Tailwind-processed) while the dashboard Memory panel uses Tailwind utility classes. Decision: match each surface's existing register rather than unify. Three new classes added to `made.css` (`.made-learning-group`, `.made-learning-group-title`, `.made-learning`) recreate the italic-quote + gold-left-border visual rhythm inside the drawer's standalone CSS, without pulling Tailwind into the drawer.

**Grouping order within the drawer section:**
Fixed (not data-driven): Drafter self-reflection first, Learner producer-side pattern second, reader third, zita fourth. Rationale: self-reflection reads as narrative first-person critique — more reader-interesting; producer/reader/zita are progressively terser and more system-y. Readers clicking "What the system learned" find the most human-voiced material first.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Flat list with per-row source attribution** (instead of grouping). Rejected per the Build 2 handoff which explicitly called for grouping; also the 2026-04-20 piece has 9 rows across two sources and grouping makes the tonal shift between Drafter reflection and Learner pattern visually obvious.
- **Pull the drawer into Tailwind.** Rejected — bigger change than this commit warranted, and the drawer's `made.css` standalone convention matches `beats.css` / `zita.css` deliberately.
- **Inline explanatory copy under the drawer's section heading** (mentioning the dashboard Memory panel as a pointer). Drafted, then struck per Zishan's feedback: the section heading + group labels + observations do the work silently; adding "Zeemish explaining Zeemish to Zeemish" is the kind of self-reference the voice contract avoids. If a later session discovers confusion, can be added then.

**Data observation worth naming:**
The 2026-04-17 drawer shows 4 StructureEditor-origin producer learnings, all of which read as audit violations ("Hook exceeds one screen…") rather than forward-going lessons. That's faithful to what StructureEditor actually writes — logged as its own followup ("StructureEditor writes violation-shaped observations into learnings"). Honesty over prettiness; retune when next retuning StructureEditor.

**Loop status after the two builds:**
- Producer signal → Drafter: wired end-to-end (P1.3), now reader-visible.
- Self-reflection → Drafter: wired end-to-end (P1.4), now reader-visible.
- Reader signal → Drafter: scaffolded but dormant (no readers yet); surface ready to render when rows land.
- Zita signal → Drafter: not yet (P1.5); surface ready.

## 2026-04-19: Drafter self-reflects post-publish (P1.4)
**Context:** Writers generate qualitative signal in their heads while they work — what felt thin, where the research was thinner than the writing made it sound, which beat took the most rewrites, what they'd do differently next time. Publication-time audits (voice/structure/fact) capture the *gated* signal; the honest post-hoc judgment is separate and valuable. Reader-side engagement data doesn't exist yet (no readers), and producer-side pipeline metrics (P1.3) don't capture this flavour of signal. A one-shot Sonnet call asking the Drafter role to review its own output gives the Learner a qualitative feed from day 1.

**Decision:** After every `publishing done`, Director fires `Drafter.reflect(brief, mdx, date)` off-pipeline via `this.schedule(1, 'reflectOnPieceScheduled', ...)`. The call re-reads the committed MDX from GitHub (same pattern as the audio alarm), carries the original brief in the alarm payload so the prompt has both "what was asked" and "what was produced", and writes up to 10 learnings with `source='self-reflection'`.

**Prompt shape — deliberate:**
- **Opens by naming the stateless reality.** "You didn't write this piece — a prior invocation with this same role did. You're being asked to review it as the same role would, with honest post-hoc judgment. Don't LARP memories; evaluate what's on the page." Without this framing the model tends to fabricate remembered struggle; with it, the model evaluates the piece as a peer editor would. Constraint from Zishan, carried verbatim in intent.
- **Specific in the ask.** "What felt thin? Which topic were you stretching on where the research was thinner than the writing made it sound? Which beat would have taken the most rewrites? If you wrote a follow-up tomorrow, what would you do differently?" Generic "reflect on this piece" prompts produce generic hedging output; specificity forces substance.
- **Explicit bans on review-speak.** "No hedging. No 'overall the piece was strong' throat-clearing. No summaries of what the piece did. Write like you're telling a trusted editor what actually happened." The bullets we want are the ones a writer wouldn't put in a revision note.
- **Output contract mirrors P1.3's `LEARNER_POST_PUBLISH_PROMPT`:** `{learnings: [{category, observation}]}`. Category normalisation + fallback same as Learner (unknown → `structure`). This is so the three origins (producer / reader / self-reflection) compound into one feed that Drafter's `getRecentLearnings(10)` reads without any slicing logic.
- **User message includes brief + final MDX only.** No scores, no round counts. Scores anchor the model's judgment to a number and invite review-speak; we want unprompted post-hoc reflection on the writing itself.

**Operational constraints — per Zishan:**
- **Non-retriable on failure.** `Drafter.reflect` throws on Claude/JSON errors; Director catches in `reflectOnPieceScheduled`, logs via `observer.logReflectionFailure(date, title, reason)`, and returns. No retry logic. The piece is live; a missed reflection isn't catastrophic.
- **Cap writes at 10 per run.** Same constant semantics as P1.3 (`REFLECTION_WRITE_CAP = 10` in drafter.ts, mirroring `PRODUCER_LEARNINGS_WRITE_CAP`). If the call produces more than 10, it's restating the same pattern — tightening the prompt is the fix, not raising the cap. Overflow is surfaced in the metered observer event.
- **Metered on every run.** Director calls `observer.logReflectionMetered(date, title, {written, overflowCount, considered, tokensIn, tokensOut, durationMs})`. This is the one Sonnet call in the pipeline that doesn't gate anything — so if it silently grows in cost over time (model produces longer reflections, MDX grows, whatever), we want visibility before it matters. Not a hard cap, just a breadcrumb. Info severity so it doesn't clutter the admin feed; the warn/escalation budget stays for actual failures.

**Alarm ordering:**
Both P1.3 (`analyseProducerSignalsScheduled`) and P1.4 (`reflectOnPieceScheduled`) fire at `this.schedule(1, …)`, then audio fires at `this.schedule(2, …)`. The Agents SDK alarm queue serialises them on the same DO; no races because the DO is single-threaded. Order within the same second isn't guaranteed but doesn't matter — neither depends on the other.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Fire inline after Integrator's final pass (pre-publish).** Rejected. Consistency was the decisive argument: keeping the post-publish learning machinery behind a single boundary (alarm → scheduled method) for both Learner and reflection means disabling or debugging either is one code path, not two. Also: Claude is stateless between calls, so there's no memory-freshness benefit to firing pre-publish.
- **Single combined scheduled method that calls both Learner and Drafter.reflect.** Rejected. Two independent signals with independent failure modes; separate methods means one can go wrong without affecting the other. Alarm queue handles ordering for free.
- **Pass final MDX in the alarm payload instead of re-reading from GitHub.** Rejected. Payload size discipline — Phase F audio work established the "re-read from GitHub" pattern for exactly this reason.
- **Hard cap on reflection tokens or cost.** Rejected for v1 — user preference is visibility first, enforce later if drift actually happens.

**Loop status after P1.4:**
- Producer signal → Drafter: wired end-to-end (P1.3).
- Self-reflection → Drafter: **wired end-to-end.** `reflect()` → `learnings (source='self-reflection')` → `getRecentLearnings(10)` on the next run.
- Reader signal → Drafter: scaffolded but dormant (no readers yet).
- Zita signal → Drafter: not yet (P1.5).

**Verification:** Unit-tested the prompt builder — system prompt opens with the stateless-reality line, contains all the specific-ask language (be honest, what felt thin, stretching, three-to-six bullets, no hedging, no throat-clearing), carries the JSON contract; user message includes brief + full MDX but omits scores/round counts. Type-check on agents workspace: 33 pre-existing errors, 33 after. Behaviour will first exercise tonight's 2am UTC cron — expect one `Reflection: <title>` info event in observer_events per publish, with tokens-in/out + latency.

## 2026-04-19: Learner writes producer-origin learnings post-publish (P1.3 — behaviour)
**Context:** Plumbing for the `source` column landed in the previous commit ([DECISIONS entry elided — see migration 0011 + writeLearning signature change]). This commit turns it on. The Learner has been reader-engagement-only since launch; since no readers exist on daily pieces yet, the learnings feed the Drafter reads has been narrow (mostly StructureEditor's auditor-time writes). Producer-side signal — which auditor findings recurred, which candidate Curator picked vs the 49 it skipped, how many revision rounds a piece needed, what the final voice score was — was visible to the Director in `audit_results` + `pipeline_log` + `daily_candidates` but never flowed into the learning loop.

**Decision:** After every `publishing done`, Director fires `Learner.analysePiecePostPublish(date)` off-pipeline via `this.schedule(1, 'analyseProducerSignalsScheduled', ...)`. The Learner reads the full quality record for the date, sends a compact context to Claude (Sonnet 4.5), parses a strict JSON response `{learnings: [{category, observation}]}`, and writes the first 10 rows with `source='producer'`. Drafter's `getRecentLearnings(10)` from P1.1 then picks these up on the next run.

**Design choices — explicit:**
- **Trigger at `publishing done`, not `audio-publishing done`.** Producer-side signal is complete the moment text is live — the revision rounds, voice score, candidates picked vs skipped are all settled. Audio lands in its own separate signal category (audio-producer failures, character budgets) that can flow through a future hook without waiting for audio to bind to text. Firing earlier means tomorrow's Drafter starts benefiting from today's lessons ~2 minutes sooner, which matters at zero cost.
- **Off-pipeline, non-blocking.** `this.schedule(1, ...)` not `await learner.analysePiecePostPublish(...)` directly. The piece is already live; the learning is nice-to-have, and must never delay publishing.
- **Non-retriable on failure.** If Claude errors, JSON is malformed, or D1 chokes, Director's `analyseProducerSignalsScheduled` logs to `observer_events` via `observer.logLearnerFailure(date, title, reason)` and returns. No retry loop. The piece is live; a missed batch of learnings isn't catastrophic and retry logic is exactly the kind of defensive code that turns into mystery failures later — deliberate constraint from Zishan.
- **Cap writes at 10 per run; log overflow.** Learner slices `.slice(0, 10)` and returns `overflowCount`. If >0, Director calls `observer.logLearnerOverflow(...)` as a warn event. Usually means the analysis restated the same pattern N ways — a cheap signal that the prompt needs tightening. Constant `PRODUCER_LEARNINGS_WRITE_CAP = 10` in [learner.ts](../agents/src/learner.ts) so the number is searchable.
- **Category normalisation, not constraint.** Claude's returned `category` is lowercased and matched against the four known values (voice / structure / fact / engagement). Anything else falls back to `structure` — a safe default because every prompt sees structure findings. No CHECK constraint, no throw; the `category` column's enum is a convention, not a contract.
- **Dedicated observer methods over reused `logError`.** `logLearnerFailure` (warn) and `logLearnerOverflow` (warn) surface with specific titles in the admin feed rather than generic "Error: learner-post-publish" noise. Small observability win; ~15 lines in `observer.ts`.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Hand the Learner its own alarm loop with per-piece retry.** Rejected per Zishan's non-retriable constraint. Dead simple to add later if the failure rate turns out to warrant it — for now, silence on failure is fine.
- **Write from the Director directly, skip the LearnerAgent subagent hop.** Rejected — agents own their own prompts and state. The Learner is already the right place to think about learnings; routing producer signal through the same agent keeps the "watch everything, write to learnings" concept honest.
- **Trigger at `done done` (final step) instead of `publishing done`.** Rejected — `done done` fires one log-line after `publishing done` with no new information. Earlier is strictly better.
- **Deeper quality record (include full MDX body, entire pipeline_log payloads).** Rejected for v1. Context is already ~3-10KB for a typical piece; adding the MDX body would triple it for marginal extra signal. If a specific learning needs body context, add it selectively.

**Loop status after P1.3:**
- Producer signal → Drafter: **wired end-to-end.** Post-publish Learner → `learnings (source='producer')` → Drafter's `getRecentLearnings(10)` on the next run.
- Reader signal → Drafter: scaffolded but dormant (no readers yet).
- Self-reflection → Drafter: not yet (P1.4).
- Zita signal → Drafter: not yet (P1.5).

**Verification:** Type-check on agents workspace — 33 errors before, 33 after (all pre-existing Agents-SDK inference issues in server.ts; zero from the changes in this commit). Behaviour will first exercise tonight's 2am UTC cron: after `publishing done`, a `analyseProducerSignalsScheduled` alarm fires; on success, 0–10 rows land in `learnings` with `source='producer'`; on failure, a warn event titled "Post-publish learnings missed: …" appears in observer_events.

## 2026-04-19: Drafter reads learnings at runtime (P1.1 — closing the self-improvement loop)
**Context:** Twelve of thirteen agents have been running identical prompts every day since launch. The `learnings` table was effectively write-only — StructureEditor and Learner wrote into it, but no agent's runtime prompt read from it. That meant every day started from scratch regardless of what prior pieces taught us. The self-improvement loop existed in principle only.

**Decision:** Drafter now reads the 10 most recent rows from `learnings` at runtime and includes them in its user-message prompt as a "Lessons from prior pieces" block, positioned between the Voice Contract and the Brief. This is the first closing of the loop — from here, every subsequent Drafter run sees what the system has learned.

**Design choices — explicit:**
- **Recency-only, no relevance scoring.** `getRecentLearnings(DB, 10)` orders by `created_at DESC` across all categories (structure, voice, engagement, fact — and forthcoming producer / self-reflection / zita). Recency is a cheap, defensible v1. Relevance scoring (tag match against the brief's underlying subject, confidence-weighted) is a later refinement if the recency-only feed proves noisy.
- **No source filter.** Deliberate. When P1.3 adds a `source` column (reader / producer / self-reflection / zita), the default Drafter query still pulls all origins — we want the producer-side signal to compound with reader signal, not be quarantined. Category-filtered reads remain available by adding a separate function; the bare `getRecentLearnings` intentionally widens.
- **Block is semantically named.** "Lessons from prior pieces" — not "Additional context" or "Notes". Block names shape how Claude weights the content; a vague name invites the model to treat the block as decorative.
- **Voice contract still wins on conflict.** Explicit line in the block: "These lessons guide. The voice contract binds. If they conflict, the contract wins." A learning that says "try hedging more" cannot override the voice contract's "no hedging" rule.
- **Empty-state omits the block entirely.** No "No learnings yet" placeholder. On day 1 of the closed loop, the Drafter prompt is identical to its pre-P1.1 shape. The block only appears once something has been written.
- **Fail-open on DB read.** A D1 hiccup must not block a draft. `getRecentLearnings` is wrapped in try/catch; on failure, learnings = [] and the block silently absents itself.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **System-prompt inclusion.** Rejected. System prompts are static cache-friendly artifacts; runtime learnings belong in the user message alongside the brief, where they're contextual to the specific task.
- **Per-category rotation.** Rejected. A reader of the prompt should see the full current-truth, not a curated slice.
- **Confidence filtering (only learnings with confidence ≥ N).** Rejected for v1. Low-confidence learnings are still information; Claude can weight them by the `[category]` prefix and the observation text itself.

**Loop status after P1.1:**
- Producer signal → Drafter: **wired** (pending P1.3 to start writing producer-side rows — until then the feed is mostly StructureEditor's existing writes).
- Self-reflection → Drafter: not yet (P1.4).
- Reader signal → Drafter: not yet (P1.5 + no readers yet).
- Zita signal → Drafter: not yet (P1.5 + no Zita traffic yet).

**Verification:** Unit-tested `buildDrafterPrompt` with (a) empty learnings — block absent, no "contract wins" sentinel, (b) 3 learnings across 3 categories — block present, all 3 observations included, ordering `Voice Contract` → `Lessons` → `Today's Brief`. Type-check on the agents workspace shows zero new errors (33 pre-existing, 33 post — all unrelated Agents SDK inference issues in server.ts).

## 2026-04-19: Frontmatter edits permitted for display-layer fixes (`beatTitles` map)
**Context:** Drafter authors beat headings in kebab-case (`## qvcs-original-advantage`). `rehype-beats.ts` humanises these for display at build time (`qvcs-original-advantage` → "Qvcs Original Advantage"). That round-trip is lossy: apostrophes, colons, and acronym casing the kebab form can't express are gone by the time the display string is generated, so pieces render headings like "Qvcs Original Advantage" instead of "QVC's Original Advantage" and "Teaching 1 The Fuel Equation" instead of "Teaching 1: The Fuel Equation". The display-layer plugin alone can't recover punctuation that was never in the MDX.

**Decision:** Add an optional `beatTitles` frontmatter map — `{ beatSlug: "Human Display Title" }` — that `rehype-beats` prefers over `humanize(slug)`. Retroactively apply to pieces where the default humanise produces wrong output. Leave the Drafter-authored body untouched.

**Permanence rule carve-out:** Per the existing precedent for `audioBeats`, `voiceScore`, and `qualityFlag` (see `metadata_vs_content` memory + publisher.ts:25-29 "Metadata carve-out" comment), frontmatter edits are metadata, not content. `beatTitles` joins that set. The MDX body — the piece's teaching — stays byte-for-byte identical. This explicitly permits editing published pieces' frontmatter when the change is a display-layer fix that can't be expressed any other way.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Fix Drafter going forward to write human headings into MDX (`## QVC's Original Advantage`).** Rejected as the primary fix because it leaves the three already-published pieces mangled forever under the permanence rule. Still worth doing in parallel for future pieces, and rehype-beats already handles non-kebab headings correctly via the `isKebabOnly` branch. Tracked separately.
- **Teach humanize() to recognise known acronyms (QVC, USA, NATO).** Rejected as too narrow and too magic — a heading like `qvcs-original-advantage` needs both an acronym-detect and a punctuation-insert (`'s`), and generalising that is a larger problem than the fix deserves.
- **Add a separate per-beat YAML block with display fields (e.g. `beats: [{slug, title, audio}]`).** Rejected as scope creep — `audioBeats` already exists as a separate map and mirroring that shape for titles keeps the additions parallel and small.

**Scope of retroactive apply (2026-04-19):**
- 2026-04-17: `qvcs-original-advantage` → "QVC's Original Advantage". Also corrected `beatCount: 6` → `beatCount: 8` (Drafter-declared count drifted from actual `##` count — separate known issue in CLAUDE.md Remaining minor items, fixed on this piece as a metadata-only correction since we were touching frontmatter anyway).
- 2026-04-18: not needed — `humanize()` produces correct output for all its headings.
- 2026-04-19: four `teaching-N-*` headings → "Teaching N: ..." (restore colons + lowercase "and" in the second).

## 2026-04-19: Revert 02882fd — audio double-publish corrupted frontmatter
**Context:** Retro audio generation for 2026-04-17 via admin Continue button produced two `audio-publishing done` events — 543651b (valid) and 02882fd (corrupted). The second commit deleted the audioBeats map and collapsed `qualityFlag: "low"\n---\n` onto a single line, leaving the MDX with no YAML terminator. Live site unaffected (still serving cached HTML built from 543651b), but next deploy would have built from the corrupted state.

**Decision:** `git revert 02882fd`. Smallest safe action — preserves history, doesn't hide the bug. Audio data in D1/R2 is intact; only the MDX frontmatter splice got mangled.

**Root cause NOT fixed here.** Two stacked bugs (Publisher.publishAudio non-idempotent on second call + Director Continue path firing full re-run instead of resuming) tracked in [docs/FOLLOWUPS.md](FOLLOWUPS.md). Out of today's improvement-plan scope. Tonight's 2am UTC cron is a fresh pipeline (not a retry), so it's unaffected by the Continue-path trigger; tomorrow's piece should land clean.

## 2026-04-18: Ship as-is despite security-header gap on prerendered HTML (LAUNCH)
**Context:** zeemish.io custom-domain swap completed. All security-critical surfaces (`/dashboard/`, `/account`, `/login`, `/api/*`, `/auth/*`, `/audio/*`) are returning all 6 security headers — confirmed via curl. But the public read-only pages (`/`, `/daily/*`, `/library`) still return without security headers and with Cloudflare's default `cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`. Three workarounds attempted in sequence (run_worker_first=true → middleware Cache-Control no-store on HTML → post-build.sh overriding _routes.json to include /*) all failed: Cloudflare Workers Static Assets serves `.html` files directly from the asset binding, bypassing the worker entirely, regardless of all three settings. Verified: `_routes.json` IS deployed correctly (`curl https://zeemish.io/_routes.json` shows the override), and the worker IS running for non-HTML routes (the new cache-control lands on `/dashboard/`).

**Decision:** Launch zeemish.io to the public with this gap. Document it explicitly. Move on. Don't keep iterating.

**Reason — risk analysis:**
- The pages missing headers are read-only HTML with no auth, no forms, no cross-origin fetches, no third-party scripts beyond a Google Fonts preconnect
- Headers we'd want on them are CSP (mostly to constrain what the page can fetch — moot, it doesn't fetch anything cross-origin), X-Frame-Options (clickjacking — there's no sensitive UI to overlay), X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing — only matters for content the browser would mis-execute, irrelevant for static HTML)
- The realistic residual risk is clickjacking. For a public reading site with no actions, that's a low-impact vulnerability. An attacker iframing a Zeemish daily piece to overlay something else achieves nothing — there's nothing to phish, no buttons to mis-click into a transaction
- The auth surfaces (where headers DO land) are the actual attack surface. Those are hardened
- Fixing this would require either (a) a Cloudflare Transform Rule (UI work, splits config), or (b) making prerendered pages server-rendered (loses prerender perf benefit, every request re-renders MDX through worker). Neither change is worth blocking launch for
- The user explicitly weighed this and chose to ship: "I dont think its too much of a big risk as they are read only pages not like admin pages that already rendered on the server side"

**Reason — why this matters as a documented decision:** Future-me or future-them will discover the missing headers in a security scan or audit and want to know whether this was an oversight or a deliberate trade-off. It was deliberate. The path to close the gap is in `Remaining minor items` in CLAUDE.md.

**Lessons captured for next time:**
1. Cloudflare Workers Static Assets has surprising precedence over worker-side configuration. `run_worker_first` and `_routes.json` `include` patterns are not the safety net you'd expect for `.html` files. If you need headers on static HTML, plan for it from the start — either prerender to dist with build-time HTML transformation, or use Cloudflare Transform Rules from day one.
2. Don't trust `cf-cache-status: HIT` to mean "old cache, will fix on next purge." It can also mean "Cloudflare is serving the asset directly without any cache logic running." Distinguish via cache-bypass tests on routes you KNOW are server-rendered.
3. Custom-domain swaps need at least one Cloudflare cache purge after the bind. Future-proof: add a `gh workflow_dispatch` step that calls Cloudflare's purge API after each deploy. Or set Cache Rules in the dashboard to `bypass` for HTML.

**Launch state captured at git tag `v1.0.0`.**

**References:** [src/middleware.ts](../src/middleware.ts), [scripts/post-build.sh](../scripts/post-build.sh), [wrangler.toml](../wrangler.toml), CLAUDE.md "Critical lesson — Cloudflare Workers Static Assets" + "Launch (2026-04-18 — v1.0.0)".

## 2026-04-18: Override Astro Cloudflare adapter's _routes.json (post-launch hotfix)
**Context:** zeemish.io went live via custom domain swap. Smoke test on the live domain showed `cf-cache-status: HIT` and zero security headers on `/`, `/daily/*`, `/library` — but headers ARE present on `/dashboard/`, `/api/*`, `/audio/*`. Three Cloudflare cache purges didn't fix it. Diagnosis: the Astro Cloudflare adapter auto-generates `dist/_routes.json` with prerendered paths in the `exclude` list, which tells Cloudflare to serve those files directly from Static Assets WITHOUT invoking the worker. `run_worker_first = true` in wrangler.toml is overridden by this exclude list — Cloudflare honours `_routes.json` first.

**Decision:** Add `scripts/post-build.sh` that overwrites `dist/_routes.json` after `astro build` runs. New file routes ALL paths through the worker via `include: ["/*"]`, with only true static assets (`/_astro/*` bundled JS/CSS, `/og-image.svg`, `/robots.txt`) in `exclude`. This makes the middleware-applied security headers reach prerendered HTML.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Adapter `routes.extend.include` config option.** Documented per the adapter type defs. Rejected because the docs explicitly say "exclude always takes priority over include" — and the adapter's auto-generated excludes already list every prerendered path. Adding to include doesn't unlist them.
- **Cloudflare Transform Rules in dashboard.** Would work and apply to ALL responses regardless of cache state. Rejected because (a) splits header config between code and Cloudflare UI, (b) requires manual setup, (c) would re-apply on every domain swap. Code-side fix is portable.
- **Make `/`, `/daily/[date]`, `/library` server-rendered (`prerender = false`).** Loses the prerender perf benefit (every request would re-render MDX through the worker). Rejected — overkill for a header problem.
- **Set `_headers` in `public/`.** Workers Static Assets does not honour `_headers` (that's a Pages-only feature). Already learned this in the morning's pass.

**Reason — why post-build script over adapter config:** The adapter has no exposed knob for the auto-exclude behaviour. A post-build script is a small, obvious, contained workaround that survives adapter upgrades. If the adapter ever adds a `routes.strategy` option, we can rip the script out without other changes.

**Cost:** All static-HTML requests now invoke the worker (~1-5 ms added per request). At our scale, negligible. The `Cache-Control: private, no-store` middleware sets on HTML means CDN won't cache HTML, so the worker runs on every request — but Workers are fast and the rendered HTML is tiny. Bundled JS/CSS (`/_astro/*`) still get edge-cached and served direct from assets, so performance for repeat visitors is preserved.

**References:** [scripts/post-build.sh](../scripts/post-build.sh), [src/middleware.ts](../src/middleware.ts) (the `applySecurityHeaders` content-type check), [package.json](../package.json) (build script), [wrangler.toml](../wrangler.toml) (`run_worker_first = true`). See CLAUDE.md "Critical lesson — Cloudflare Workers Static Assets" for the three-layer mental model that's needed to reason about this in future.

## 2026-04-18: Launch-readiness pass before zeemish.io domain swap
**Context:** About to retire the old `zeemish.io` (separate breathing-tools product) and bind `zeemish-v2` to the apex. Audited what was actually broken vs. what CLAUDE.md *claimed* was broken. CLAUDE.md "Remaining minor items" had drifted: site worker R2 binding and `/audio/*` route were already shipped, daily-piece engagement writes were already firing from `<lesson-shell>`, only the surface was missing. Real launch blockers turned out to be smaller and different.

**Decisions made in this pass:**

1. **Wire `audio_plays` engagement once-per-session.** `<audio-player>` knows when audio plays; `<lesson-shell>` owns the engagement HTTP. Bridge them with a `audio-player:firstplay` custom event (paused→playing transition, fires once per page load via `hasReportedFirstPlay` guard). Lesson-shell already had `trackEngagement('audio_play')` plumbing. Alternative considered: inline POST in audio-player. Rejected — duplicates URL-parsing logic for course_id/lesson_id that lesson-shell already does, and event-based keeps audio-player free of HTTP concerns.

2. **Surface engagement on admin via server-side query.** Admin is a `.astro` page with full D1 access — no need to call the JSON `/api/dashboard/analytics` endpoint client-side. One `GROUP BY lesson_id` query; rows render with the same Tailwind/eyebrow patterns as the All Pieces list. Each row deep-links to `/dashboard/admin/piece/{lesson_id}/`. The legacy `analytics.ts` endpoint is now unused but kept (could become useful for scripted admin tooling later).

3. **Move security headers from `public/_headers` into middleware + flip `run_worker_first = true`.** Cloudflare Workers Static Assets does not honour `_headers` (that's Cloudflare Pages, a different product). Live response had ZERO security headers despite a fully-populated `_headers` file. Middleware can apply headers — but only runs for requests that hit the worker, so prerendered pages (home, daily, library) were skipped. Two options: (a) copy headers into a build-time HTML transform, or (b) `run_worker_first = true` so the worker handles every request including static assets. Picked (b): one extra worker invocation per asset, negligible at our scale, single source of truth, no build-step gymnastics. Cost: paying ~1ms CPU per asset request that previously was free. Worth it for headers correctness across the full surface. `public/_headers` deleted to prevent future devs from trusting it.

4. **CSP simplified.** Old policy hard-coded `connect-src https://zeemish-agents.zzeeshann.workers.dev` because the live `_headers` was the model. New policy: `connect-src 'self'`. The site does NOT call the Agents worker from the browser — site→agents traffic uses the Cloudflare service binding (`[[services]]` in wrangler.toml) which is in-process, not a network fetch. Removing the workers.dev URL from CSP also avoids stale-domain rot once we move to zeemish.io.

5. **Documented Range-request bug as deferred minor item.** `/audio/*` route claims Range support but returns 200 with full body on `Range: bytes=0-1023`. Per-beat clips are small (~480KB) so browsers cope; deferring the fix until a real seek-bandwidth complaint arrives.

**Reason — why audit instead of just executing:** First instinct was "audio's broken, engagement's not tracked, fix both." Reading the code showed both were further along than CLAUDE.md indicated. The honest pre-launch list was much shorter (and different) than the claimed one. Lesson: trust code over docs when they disagree. Added to the launch process: walk CLAUDE.md against reality before any release.

## 2026-04-18: Un-pause audio pipeline (ship-and-retry, metadata carve-out)
**Context:** Audio Producer + Audio Auditor had been paused since build (not wired into Director's pipeline, zero ElevenLabs spend possible by accident). Text pipeline was trusted; time to un-pause.

**Decision:** Wire audio in as a phase AFTER Publisher, not before. Ship text the moment Integrator approves. Run Audio Producer → Audio Auditor → `Publisher.publishAudio` (second commit splicing `audioBeats` into frontmatter) as a best-effort chase. Failures escalate to Observer; the admin piece-deep-dive page shows a "Retry audio" button that POSTs `/audio-retry` and re-runs the audio pipeline against the committed MDX.

**Reason — ship-and-retry over atomic:** The user framed it clearly: "have you seen a day where a newspaper didn't publish?" Strict atomic (block text publish on audio failure) would let ElevenLabs outages, Workers quirks, or a one-character typo in the transcript skip a day. A daily-cadence product can't afford that. Audio is a preferred-but-not-required enhancement. Text is the contract.

**Reason — metadata carve-out:** The `publishAudio` second commit modifies an already-published MDX file. A strict reading of CLAUDE.md's "Published pieces are permanent. No agent writes to, revises, regenerates, or updates any published piece." forbids this. User's explicit clarification: the rule governs teaching **content** (beats, narrative, facts), not frontmatter **metadata** (voiceScore, qualityFlag, audioBeats). `publishToPath` still refuses to overwrite (content rule intact). `publishAudio` is the only metadata-update path.

**Decisions bundled in:**
- **Model:** stay on `eleven_multilingual_v2`. `eleven_v3` is alpha + audio tags, no prosodic stitching, wrong fit for calm teaching narration. Flash v2.5 is speed-not-quality.
- **Voice:** Frederick Surrey (`j9jfwdrw7BRfcR43Qohk`), added to "My Voices" to guard against shared-library removal.
- **Format:** `mp3_44100_96`. Indistinguishable from 128 for a single voice; ~25% smaller R2 + egress.
- **Pronunciation:** "Zeemish" → "Zee-mish" via `prepareForTTS` text substitution. SSML not supported; PLS dictionaries work on v2 only for alias rules, not IPA — text substitution is simpler and equivalent for one brand word.
- **Budget:** 20,000 chars/piece hard cap (`AudioBudgetExceededError`). Sized for a 12-beat newspaper-style piece (~$2/day at $0.10/1k chars). Checked pre-flight, before any API call.
- **Granularity:** per-beat MP3s. `<lesson-shell>` → `<audio-player>` sync lets readers jump to any beat; future 12-beat newspaper pieces work cleanly on this shape.
- **Retry:** Producer does 3-attempt exponential backoff internally on 5xx. 4xx fails fast (bad key, quota). Director escalates to Observer on any uncaught failure. Admin dashboard retry button re-runs the audio pipeline against the committed MDX.
- **Schema:** new `daily_piece_audio` table (per-beat rows) is the query source of truth. `daily_pieces.has_audio` boolean for fast dashboard filtering. Frontmatter `audioBeats` map is the render source of truth for the site. Both kept in sync by `Publisher.publishAudio`.

**References:** `migrations/0010_audio_pipeline.sql`, `agents/src/audio-producer.ts`, `agents/src/audio-auditor.ts`, `agents/src/director.ts` (`runAudioPipeline`, `retryAudio`), `agents/src/publisher.ts` (`publishAudio`), `src/interactive/audio-player.ts`, `src/components/AudioPlayer.astro`, `src/pages/audio/[...path].ts` (site worker's R2 audio route).

**Deploy-time gotcha learned 2026-04-18:** Cloudflare Static Assets intercepts unrecognised paths with the prerendered 404.html **before** the worker runs, so a middleware-only `/audio/*` handler never executed. Fix: register as a real Astro route (`src/pages/audio/[...path].ts`). Also: manual `wrangler deploy` from a local build can overwrite the auto-deploy from GitHub Actions if local state is out of sync (e.g., Publisher just pushed `audioBeats` to a piece's frontmatter on GitHub — `git pull` before rebuilding).

## 2026-04-16: Chose pnpm over npm
**Context:** Setting up the repo.
**Decision:** Use pnpm for package management.
**Reason:** Faster installs, strict dependency resolution, saves disk space. Recommended in the build guide.

## 2026-04-16: Astro output mode set to `static`
**Context:** Configuring Astro for Cloudflare deployment.
**Decision:** Use `output: 'static'` (not `server` or `hybrid`).
**Reason:** Stage 1 is a static site — no server-side rendering needed yet. Static is cheaper, faster, and simpler on Cloudflare. We'll switch to `hybrid` or `server` only when we need server-side routes (Stage 3).

## 2026-04-16: Zeemish brand colours as Tailwind theme
**Context:** Setting up Tailwind config.
**Decision:** Added `zee-bg`, `zee-text`, `zee-accent` as custom Tailwind colours.
**Reason:** Keeps the colour palette consistent across components. DM Sans set as default sans font to match brand.

## 2026-04-16: Handoff docs stored in docs/handoff/
**Context:** Planning documents from the architecture phase.
**Decision:** Copy all handoff docs into the repo at `docs/handoff/`.
**Reason:** Every future Claude Code session needs access to the architecture and build guide. Keeping them in the repo means no dependency on external file paths.

## 2026-04-16: Beats as Web Components, not Astro components
**Context:** Stage 2 — deciding how to build beat navigation.
**Decision:** Use native Web Components (`<lesson-shell>`, `<lesson-beat>`) for beat navigation.
**Reason:** Beat navigation requires client-side state (show/hide on click). Astro components are build-time only. Web Components give us progressive enhancement (all beats visible without JS) and zero framework dependency.

## 2026-04-16: Single Astro Worker instead of separate site + API workers
**Context:** Stage 3 — deciding whether to build a separate `worker/` API project.
**Decision:** Keep API routes inside Astro using `src/pages/api/` with the Cloudflare adapter.
**Reason:** Avoids CORS complexity, keeps one deploy target, simpler to develop. The architecture planned three workers but Astro handles both static and server routes natively. Can split later if scale demands it.

## 2026-04-16: PBKDF2 via Web Crypto API for password hashing
**Context:** Stage 3 — choosing a password hashing approach for Cloudflare Workers.
**Decision:** Use PBKDF2 (100k iterations, SHA-256) via the Web Crypto API.
**Reason:** Works natively in Workers runtime — no npm dependencies needed. bcrypt/argon2 would require WASM or npm packages. PBKDF2 with sufficient iterations is NIST-approved and adequate for our use case.

## 2026-04-16: Middleware only on server-rendered routes
**Context:** Stage 3 — Astro middleware was crashing on prerendered pages.
**Decision:** Auth middleware checks the URL path and only runs on `/api/`, `/account`, `/login` routes.
**Reason:** Prerendered pages don't have access to D1 at build time. The middleware creates anonymous users in D1, which can only run on server-rendered routes. Lesson pages call the API from the client side instead.

## 2026-04-16: Agents as a separate Worker
**Context:** Stage 4 — setting up the agent team.
**Decision:** The agents live in `agents/` as a separate Cloudflare Worker, not inside the Astro site.
**Reason:** The Astro adapter manages its own fetch handler. Agents need Durable Object bindings with their own wrangler.toml. Separate Workers with separate concerns. Zero cost when agents are hibernated.

## 2026-04-16: getAgentByName for RPC instead of stub.fetch()
**Context:** Stage 4 — routing HTTP requests to Durable Objects.
**Decision:** Use `getAgentByName()` from the agents SDK for typed RPC calls from the main fetch handler.
**Reason:** The Agent base class's `fetch()` method expects specific SDK headers (namespace/room). Direct RPC via `getAgentByName` gives typed method calls and avoids header confusion.

## 2026-04-16: Voice contract as TypeScript string, not .md import
**Context:** Stage 4 — agents need the voice contract text.
**Decision:** Duplicate the voice contract as a string constant in `agents/src/shared/voice-contract.ts`.
**Reason:** Wrangler's bundler has no loader for `.md` files. The canonical version stays at `content/voice-contract.md`; the TS copy is kept in sync manually.

## 2026-04-16: Agent-chosen lesson topics instead of following course spine
**Context:** Stage 5 — producing the first 12-lesson course.
**Decision:** Let the Curator agent choose lesson topics freely rather than following the original 12-lesson spine from the brief.
**Reason:** The Curator produces better, more engaging titles when given creative freedom. The original spine ("20,000 breaths", "The nose knows") was a planning guide, not a requirement. The agents produced titles like "Why you can't tickle yourself" which are more compelling and still cover the body course subject.

## 2026-04-16: Synchronous RPC instead of Cloudflare Workflows v2
**Context:** Stage 4 — implementing the publishing pipeline.
**Decision:** Use synchronous sub-agent RPC calls instead of Cloudflare Workflows v2.
**Reason:** Faster to ship. The pipeline works end-to-end as synchronous calls. Trade-off: no durable checkpoints, pipeline cannot survive Worker restarts mid-execution. Workflows v2 can be added later without changing the agent logic — just wrap the existing calls in `step.do()`.

## 2026-04-16: Zita API in Astro site worker, not agents worker
**Context:** Stage 7 — building the Zita chat guide.
**Decision:** Zita's API endpoint lives in the Astro site (`/api/zita/chat`) not in the agents worker.
**Reason:** Zita needs the user's session cookie (from the auth middleware) and their conversation history from D1. The Astro site already has both. Putting Zita in the agents worker would require cross-worker auth, adding complexity.

## 2026-04-16: Coerce estimatedTime schema to handle agent output
**Context:** Stage 5 — agent-authored lessons had `estimatedTime: 18` (number) instead of `"18 min"` (string).
**Decision:** Changed Zod schema to `z.coerce.string()` for `estimatedTime`.
**Reason:** Agent output varies. Coercing is more robust than trying to enforce exact format in agent prompts. Numbers become strings automatically.

## 2026-04-17: Frederick Surrey as the Zeemish voice
**Context:** Choosing an ElevenLabs voice for lesson audio.
**Decision:** Frederick Surrey — British, male, middle-aged, calm, narrative style.
**Reason:** Matches the Zeemish tone: calm, direct, warm but not performative. Zishan's choice.

## 2026-04-17: Audio failure doesn't block text publishing
**Context:** Wiring audio generation into the publishing pipeline.
**Decision:** If audio generation or audit fails, the text lesson still publishes. Audio failure is logged via Observer but doesn't block.
**Reason:** Audio is enhancement, not core. A published lesson without audio is better than a blocked lesson. Audio can be regenerated later.

## 2026-04-17: Audio generated once per lesson, served from R2
**Context:** Cost model for audio.
**Decision:** Generate MP3 once via ElevenLabs, store in R2 bucket. Readers stream from R2.
**Reason:** ~$5 per lesson to generate. $0 per play after that. R2 serving is essentially free at this scale.

## 2026-04-17: Cancel passphrase auth, keep magic link
**Context:** Architecture planned both passphrase (6 BIP39 words) and magic link as login options.
**Decision:** Cancel passphrase auth. Build magic link instead.
**Reason:** They solve the same problem — passwordless login. Magic link is simpler, universally understood, and pairs with the existing email upgrade flow. Passphrase is clever but adds complexity readers don't need.

## 2026-04-17: Resend.com for magic link emails
**Context:** Choosing an email provider for magic link delivery.
**Decision:** Use Resend.com (free tier: 100 emails/day).
**Reason:** Simple API (one fetch call), no npm deps, generous free tier. Using test domain for now (onboarding@resend.dev) — needs verified domain for production.

## 2026-04-17: Two-pass Fact-Checker with web search
**Context:** Fact-Checker was failing too often on claims it couldn't verify from training data alone.
**Decision:** Two-pass approach: (1) Claude identifies claims, (2) DuckDuckGo instant answers for unverified/incorrect claims, (3) Claude re-assesses with search results.
**Reason:** Adds real-world verification without external API dependencies. DuckDuckGo is free and doesn't require an API key. Not as deep as a full search engine, but catches obvious errors.

## 2026-04-17: Learnings written by StructureEditor, reviewed by Director
**Context:** Architecture Section 4.3 describes a cross-lesson consistency system.
**Decision:** StructureEditor writes observations to the learnings table when it finds patterns. Director reviews audit patterns after each autonomous run and logs recurring issues via Observer.
**Reason:** Starts the learning loop without over-engineering. Observations accumulate, the Director surfaces recurring problems, and Zishan can act on them.

## 2026-04-17: PublishLessonWorkflow for durable pipeline execution
**Context:** Pipeline was synchronous RPC — wouldn't survive Worker restarts.
**Decision:** Added PublishLessonWorkflow using Cloudflare Workflows v2 via agents SDK. Each pipeline step (curate, draft, audit, revise, audio, publish) is a durable checkpoint.
**Reason:** Durable execution is critical for a pipeline that takes 1-2 minutes. If the Worker cold-starts mid-pipeline, it resumes from the last completed step instead of starting over.

## 2026-04-17: Security hardening — 21 issues addressed
**Context:** Comprehensive security audit found 5 critical, 5 high, 7 medium, 4 low issues.
**Decision:** Fixed all critical and high issues in one pass.
**Changes:**
- Added `Secure` flag to session cookies
- Timing-safe password comparison (prevents timing attacks)
- Email uniqueness check on upgrade (prevents account hijacking)
- All agents endpoints now require ADMIN_SECRET auth (not just /trigger)
- CORS restricted to site domain (was `*`)
- Removed query parameter auth (secrets leak in logs)
- CSRF origin header check on all POST requests
- Rate limiting on Zita chat (20/15min), upgrade (5/15min)
- Input validation: message length limits, JSON try-catch on all endpoints
- Claude API errors no longer leaked to users
- Login response no longer includes user_id

## 2026-04-17: Daily Pieces system — news-driven teaching
**Context:** Zishan's vision: Zeemish should teach from today's news, every morning.
**Decision:** Added ScannerAgent (#14) + Director daily mode. Scanner fetches Google News RSS (free, no API key), Director picks the most teachable story, existing pipeline produces the piece.
**Reason:** Nobody does "today's news → today's 10-minute lesson on the underlying system." CNN gives you the news. Coursera gives you the education 6 months later. Zeemish gives you both, same morning.

## 2026-04-17: Google News RSS as first news source
**Context:** Choosing a news data source for the Scanner.
**Decision:** Google News RSS feeds (6 categories: TOP, TECH, SCIENCE, BUSINESS, HEALTH, WORLD).
**Reason:** Free, no API key, unlimited requests, covers global news. Can add NewsData.io, Guardian API, etc. later as v2 sources.

## 2026-04-17: CORS dynamic origin matching
**Context:** Agents CORS was hardcoded to workers.dev domain.
**Decision:** CORS now checks request Origin against an allowed list (workers.dev + zeemish.io). Added CORS preflight (OPTIONS) handler.
**Reason:** Workers.dev domain will change to zeemish.io in production. Dynamic matching handles both without code changes.

## 2026-04-17: CSRF origin check uses URL parsing, not substring
**Context:** Security audit found the CSRF check used `origin.includes(host)` which is bypassable.
**Decision:** Changed to `new URL(origin).host === host` for strict comparison.
**Reason:** Substring matching allows attacker domains that contain the host string. URL parsing is correct.

## 2026-04-17: Courses renamed to Library
**Context:** Daily pieces are now the primary content, not structured courses.
**Decision:** Rename Courses to Library. Library shows all daily pieces in reverse chronological order.
**Reason:** Courses imply a fixed curriculum. Library implies a growing collection. Daily pieces accumulate into the library naturally.

## 2026-04-17: "The body you live in" course removed
**Context:** Placeholder content from the old architecture before daily pieces existed.
**Decision:** Delete entirely — course metadata, all 12 lesson MDX files, course page routes.
**Reason:** Clean slate. No dead content on a live site.

## 2026-04-17: Dashboard rebuilt as admin control room
**Context:** Running an autonomous agent pipeline without visibility is dangerous.
**Decision:** Full dashboard rebuild with pipeline status, recent pieces table, observer events, engagement data, manual trigger.
**Reason:** You can't run a system you can't see.

## 2026-04-17: Zeemish Protocol established
**Context:** Zishan defined Zeemish's purpose in one line.
**Decision:** "Educate myself for humble decisions" is the founding protocol. Added to voice contract, site footer, and CLAUDE.md.
**Reason:** Every agent, every piece, every design choice serves this purpose. It's the answer to "why does this site exist?"

## 2026-04-17: Reviser does NOT revise published pieces
**Context:** Zishan clarified that published pieces are permanent records.
**Decision:** Reviser's role changed from "propose revisions to existing pieces" to "analyse engagement patterns and write learnings for future pieces." It feeds the learnings database only.
**Reason:** Published content is a permanent record. The way to improve is not to rewrite the past but to make the future better. The Drafter reads learnings when writing new pieces — that's the improvement loop.

## 2026-04-17: Reviser renamed to Learner
**Context:** "Reviser" implies changing published content. It doesn't do that.
**Decision:** Rename ReviserAgent to LearnerAgent. "Learns from reader behaviour to make future pieces better."
**Reason:** The name should match the job. It learns. It doesn't revise.

## 2026-04-17: Merge EngagementAnalyst + Reviser into LearnerAgent
**Context:** Two agents doing related work — one watched engagement, the other extracted learnings. Unnecessary separation.
**Decision:** Merge into one LearnerAgent. It watches reader engagement (completions, drop-offs, audio vs text) AND writes patterns into the learnings database. 13 agents total now (12 public + Observer internal).
**Reason:** Simpler. One agent owns the entire "learn from readers" responsibility. Fewer moving parts.

## 2026-04-17: Restore Curator + Drafter as separate agents; Director becomes a pure orchestrator
**Context:** A prior refactor merged Curator and Drafter into Director "temporarily" — migration `v10` deleted their Durable Object classes. Director ended up doing four jobs (orchestrate, curate, draft, log-on-behalf-of-others) in one 308-line file. Documentation drifted to match the code ("11 agents") instead of the architecture ("13 agents"). "Paused" audio agents were a label, not a structural fact.
**Decision:** Restore `CuratorAgent` and `DrafterAgent` as separate Durable Objects with their own files, states, and prompt files (`curator-prompt.ts`, `drafter-prompt.ts`). Director becomes a pure orchestrator with zero LLM calls. Director's state splits into `status: 'idle' | 'running' | 'error'` + `currentPhase: DirectorPhase | null`. Audio agents stay paused — Director's pipeline does not reference them, so "paused" is now structural (cannot run by accident) rather than documentary.
**Reason:** Separation of concerns makes the system observable, debuggable, and replaceable. Each agent becomes a first-class row on the dashboard with its own status and last-run. A bug in drafting no longer takes down story selection. Swapping Drafter for a new version no longer risks touching Curator logic. Cost control on audio becomes a property of the wire diagram, not a promise in a README.
**Shipped in 3 PRs:** (1) scaffold empty stubs + DO bindings + migration v11; (2) migrate prompts and logic out of Director, rewrite Director to delegate; (3) sync CLAUDE.md, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, public dashboard, admin `STEP_LABELS`.

## 2026-04-17: Decouple piece identity from publication date (planned, not yet implemented)
**Context:** After restoring Curator + Drafter and running a manual test trigger, a second piece for 2026-04-17 published cleanly through the pipeline — but Zishan could not view it on the site. Investigation showed the system treats "publication date" and "piece identity" as the same thing in three places:
1. URL routing: `src/pages/daily/[date].astro` uses `piece.data.date` as the URL param, so two pieces on the same date produce a URL collision — only one is reachable.
2. Director's guard: `SELECT id FROM daily_pieces WHERE date = ? LIMIT 1` treats "today has a piece" as "today is full".
3. Filename prefix `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx` makes the date visually dominant, though the slug is what disambiguates on disk.

The D1 `daily_pieces` table itself does not enforce date uniqueness — the conflation lives in the surface and the guard, not in the data model. So the architecture is lying about a constraint that isn't real.

**Decision:** Multiple pieces per day is the product vision, not an edge case. "One per day" was a temporary scaffold. Next session: decouple piece identity from publication date.
- URL becomes `/daily/{slug}/` (or `/pieces/{slug}/` — TBD) instead of `/daily/{date}/`. Date stays as metadata, not identity.
- Director's guard changes from "date already claimed" to "slug already published" (dedupe by content, not time).
- `content/daily-pieces/` filename pattern stays — slug is already the unique piece, date is just a sort aid.
- Library + "today's piece" sections still sort/filter by date, but no longer require uniqueness.
- Backwards compatibility: existing `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` URLs need a redirect or fallback (decide in implementation).

**Reason:** Same principle as the Director refactor — the surface should match what the architecture actually wants to express. Date-as-identity baked a 1:1 constraint into URLs and pipeline logic that neither the data model nor the product goal needs. Fixing it unlocks multiple-pieces-per-day (6 or 12 stories eventually), safe manual re-triggers during development, and accurate library rendering when pieces share a date.

**Scope for next session:** Plan the fix in detail (including URL redirect strategy for existing pieces), then implement in stages similar to the agent refactor.

## 2026-04-17: One piece per day is the product — reverse the prior "decouple" plan
**Context:** The prior entry (same day) planned to decouple piece identity from publication date to support multiple pieces per day. On reflection, Zishan decided against drifting into that larger refactor. One piece per day is the product. Architecture stays as-is.

**Decision:** Keep date-as-identity in URL routing, Director's guard, and the filename pattern. Do NOT decouple. The prior decision stands as a possibility considered and rejected; this entry supersedes it.

**Reason:** "Don't drift." The agent-side refactor we just shipped was necessary architectural work. Chasing another large surface refactor on the same day would repeat the original mistake — reacting to a surfaced edge case by rewriting the system instead of confirming the product. One story a day is simple, understandable, and fits the Zeemish Protocol. The admin force-trigger created one accidental duplicate today (two pieces for 2026-04-17) — that's a dev-mode artifact, not an architecture problem.

**Consequence for the duplicate currently in the repo:** Two pieces exist for 2026-04-17 (`europe-led-coalition...` and `what-lagging-jet-fuel...`). Both published via Publisher. The URL can only reach one. Left in place for now; Zishan can delete the unwanted one by hand later if desired, or leave as a record of the first real Curator+Drafter run.

**Remaining work tied to this:** The admin force-trigger that bypasses the guard can still create dev-mode duplicates. That's acceptable during build. If it becomes annoying later, a simple fix is to make the force-trigger delete today's D1 row + MDX file before running, so the new piece replaces instead of duplicating. Not planned — listed here so it's not forgotten.

## 2026-04-17: Agent system hardening pass — principle alignment, no silent failures
**Context:** Audit of `agents/src/` found the pipeline structurally sound but drifting from two principles documented in `docs/AGENTS.md` and `docs/handoff/ZEEMISH-V2-ARCHITECTURE-REVISED.md`: (1) "One prompt per agent, co-located in `{agent}-prompt.ts`" — followed only by Curator and Drafter, and (2) "no silent failure" — the fact-checker could return first-pass-only results when web search failed with nothing surfaced.

**Decision:** Ship an alignment pass — no behaviour change at the reader edge, no migrations, no API edits.

- Extracted inline prompts into dedicated files for voice-auditor, structure-editor, fact-checker, integrator, and learner (5 new `*-prompt.ts` files). Makes the Director's eventual prompt-edit approval surface (architecture §4.2) reviewable.
- `FactCheckResult` gained `searchAvailable: boolean`. When DuckDuckGo is unreachable, Director logs a warn via Observer so Zishan knows the draft was judged by Claude's first-pass assessment alone.
- `LearnerAgent` now uses the shared `extractJson` parser from `shared/parse-json.ts` instead of inline regex — same robustness as every other agent.
- `StructureEditorAgent` now writes learnings for both passing drafts (suggestions, confidence 60) and failing drafts (issues, confidence 40). Previously only passing-with-suggestions cases became learnings — a biased sample feeding into Drafter's future prompts (architecture §4.3).
- `IntegratorAgent` dropped dead `revisionCount` state. Director now spawns `integrator-daily-${today}` (fresh DO per day, matching the daily-cadence model and Publisher's existing pattern).
- `ScannerAgent` accepts an optional `SCANNER_RSS_FEEDS_JSON` env override with safe fallback to hardcoded defaults — feeds change without a redeploy.
- `wrangler.toml` gained a history banner above v5's migration clarifying the LearnerAgent/EngagementAnalyst/Reviser refactor trail.

**Reason:** The architecture locked the 13-agent roster and the "no silent failure" principle in April 2026. Small deviations compound into voice drift (biased learnings) and trust erosion (silent gate bypasses). This pass costs one afternoon and restores alignment before those problems materialise. Zero runtime changes to the reader path — any breakage surfaces on the next scheduled 2am UTC run and is `git revert`-reversible.

**Explicitly out of scope (not regressions, separate work):** D1 schema changes (`voice_score` is already nullable), DuckDuckGo → real search API, scanner XML regex → proper parser, weekend daily pieces, reset-today single-command script, deleting the `shared/prompts.ts` tombstone, audio pipeline (paused by design), `observer_events.severity = 'approval_needed'`.

## 2026-04-17: Dropped course-era `agent_tasks`, fixed orphaned FK on `audit_results`
**Context:** Verifying the first run against the hardened pipeline surfaced that `audit_results` had zero rows across all historical runs. Root cause: the table's `FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES agent_tasks(id)` constraint (defined in `0004_audit_results.sql`) pointed at `agent_tasks`, a table created in `0002_observer_events.sql` but never populated by any code. Every Director INSERT silently failed the FK check and the try/catch swallowed the error. Side-effect: the site dashboard's stats and today pages (`src/pages/api/dashboard/stats.ts`, `today.ts`) silently returned empty audit data.

**Decision:** Migration `0008_drop_agent_tasks.sql` drops `agent_tasks` entirely (unused since the course model was retired — see the 2026-04-17 entries above), and drops+recreates `audit_results` without the FK. The recreated table has `idx_audit_task` and `idx_audit_created` indexes for dashboard queries.

**Reason:** Courses are gone; `agent_tasks` was a leftover from the course-era architecture. Keeping a dead table with a live FK pointing at it was producing a real, invisible failure in the audit trail. Clean-slate drop is safe because `audit_results` was empty and `agent_tasks` was unused.

**Verified:** Migration ran cleanly on remote D1. Manual INSERT/SELECT/DELETE round-trip into the new `audit_results` works. Table count now 12 (was 13); migration count now 8 (was 7). Director's next run will populate `audit_results` properly, unlocking the dashboard stats and long-term per-auditor trend analysis.

## 2026-04-17: Daily pieces run every day (weekends included)

**Context:** Zeemish is sold as a *daily* teaching product but `DirectorAgent.dailyRun()` skipped Saturday/Sunday via an `isWeekend` guard. The cron (`0 2 * * *`) was already daily — only the code gated weekends out. Readers arriving on a weekend saw yesterday's piece prominent on the home page, conflicting with the brand promise.

**Decision:** Removed the `dayOfWeek`/`isWeekend` check from `agents/src/director.ts`. The scheduled run now fires every day of the week. If the news is thin on a given weekend, Curator's existing "no teachable stories" skip path logs via Observer and the day is left blank — same graceful behaviour we already have on a quiet weekday.

**Reason:** The product claim is daily. Either ship daily or change the claim. We chose ship. No new Scanner sources for weekends — the RSS feed list is already broad enough that weekends rarely lack signal, and if they do, a blank day is more honest than a forced piece. Supersedes the "weekend daily pieces" item previously listed as out of scope in the 2026-04-17 "Nine-point hardening pass" entry above.

**Verified:** TypeScript compiles clean. Docs synced in the same commit (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`). Next Saturday's 2am UTC run is the live verification.

## 2026-04-17: Admin rot swept — `isRunning` heuristic + trigger error handling

**Context:** `CLAUDE.md` flagged two admin-surface bugs as "remaining minor items." They were each small but compounding: (1) the pipeline monitor treated an audit-round `failed` status as pipeline-terminal, even though Integrator + next round follows, so the UI stopped polling in the middle of a run; (2) the admin "Trigger Daily Piece" button used a fire-and-forget `fetch` inside a sync try/catch, so HTTP failures (401, 500) never reached the UI — users saw "Starting pipeline..." stuck forever.

**Decision:**
- `src/pages/api/dashboard/pipeline.ts` — `isRunning` now keys off Director's three explicit terminal-marker steps (`done`, `error`, `skipped`). Audit-round `failed` statuses are no longer conflated with pipeline termination.
- `agents/src/server.ts` — `/daily-trigger` returns `202 Accepted` immediately and hands the pipeline work to `ctx.waitUntil()`. Caller-facing latency drops from "minutes" to "milliseconds"; errors from DO stub creation still surface synchronously.
- `src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro` — `await`s the fetch, inspects `res.ok`, surfaces HTTP status + JSON error body to the operator. Polling only begins after the 202 acks.

**Reason:** Admin tools decay first because only Zishan sees them. These two were the biggest "lie to operator" bugs on the surface — the dashboard looked trustworthy while being subtly wrong. Fixing the trigger at the source (async via `waitUntil`) meant the admin-side workaround could be removed rather than decorated.

**Verified:** Both workers build clean. Will verify end-to-end after next manual trigger — admin UI should show "Started (run YYYY-MM-DD)" immediately, polling begins, pipeline runs, `isRunning` flips to `false` only when a terminal marker is written.

## 2026-04-17: One-command reset-today script

**Context:** Dev iteration on the daily pipeline involves a 3-step reset (git rm MDX + D1 DELETE across 5 tables + trigger fresh run). Runbook documented it correctly, but typos in the SQL (notably the `observer_events.created_at` epoch-ms cutoff) had bitten us before.

**Decision:** `scripts/reset-today.sh` bundles the three steps into one command. Reads `ADMIN_SECRET` from env, uses the known-good SQL verbatim from the runbook, fails fast on any step. Manual 3-step procedure retained as a fallback.

**Reason:** Codify the known-good steps in a script so they can't drift, so the operator can't typo the epoch-ms cutoff, and so reset is one command instead of three. Zishan's ask from the previous session.

**Verified:** `bash -n` syntax check passes. Live-tested after committed alongside Phase 1-4.

## 2026-04-17: KV-backed rate limiting (replaces in-memory Map)

**Context:** `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` used a module-level `Map<key, window>`. On Cloudflare Workers, isolates die and recycle continuously and don't share state — so the limiter reset on every recycle and couldn't count across isolates. Effectively no rate limit. The login/magic-link/upgrade/Zita endpoints were all wearing this fig leaf.

**Decision:** Replace with Workers KV (`RATE_LIMIT_KV` binding). Key layout: `rl:<key>` → `{ count, resetAt }` JSON; TTL = window seconds so KV auto-expires entries. Signature went from sync to async; 4 callers updated in the same commit. Old in-memory implementation removed — no dual-path.

**Reason:** KV is eventually consistent, which introduces a small boundary window where a determined attacker could exceed the cap before KV propagates. For the soft limits we use (5 logins / 15 min, 3 magic links / hour, 20 Zita messages / 15 min) that's acceptable — we're stopping credential-stuffing and Claude-cost blowups, not an APT. The in-memory version didn't stop either.

**Verified:** `wrangler types` emits `RATE_LIMIT_KV: KVNamespace` into `Env`. `pnpm build` clean. Live verification: curl login 6 times with wrong password — 6th returns 429; wait 15 min, allowed again; `wrangler kv key list --binding=RATE_LIMIT_KV` shows the entry with TTL.

## 2026-04-17: Publish-anyway on max-revision audit failure (low-quality flag)

**Context:** On a round-3 audit failure, Director set its own status to `error`, logged escalation, and published nothing. For a daily-cadence product, that meant some days had no piece — a hole in the archive and on the home page. Zishan's call: "we still publish, the score will be low. no archive."

**Decision:** On max-revision failure, Director now:
1. Splices `qualityFlag: "low"` into MDX frontmatter (same regex pattern as Drafter's date-force);
2. Calls Publisher with a commit message tagged `[low-quality, gates: voice/structure/facts]`;
3. Inserts into `daily_pieces` with `quality_flag='low'` and `fact_check_passed` reflecting the actual last round;
4. Still logs Observer escalation (operator needs to know);
5. Completes with `status: 'idle'` (no longer `'error'`).

Reader surface:
- `/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` renders the low piece with a yellow banner acknowledging it didn't fully pass checks.
- `/library/`, `/daily/` archive index, home page's "From the library", and all dashboard archive queries filter `qualityFlag !== 'low'` / `quality_flag IS NULL`.
- `/api/dashboard/today` exposes `qualityFlag` so live tooling can badge today's low publish distinctly.
- Admin pipeline monitor labels low-quality `done` steps with "LOW QUALITY" + failed gate names.

Schema: migration `0009_quality_flag.sql` adds `daily_pieces.quality_flag TEXT DEFAULT NULL`. Content-collection schema gets `qualityFlag: z.enum(['low']).optional()`.

**Reason:** The daily promise matters more than a perfect catalogue. A blank day breaks trust in the brand; a flagged-and-filtered day preserves daily cadence while keeping the archive clean. The "Published pieces are permanent" hard rule is intact — we never revise or delete the low piece, we just exclude it from the archive presentation.

**Verified:** Both workers build clean. Full verification requires a forced audit failure — will run on next reset-today cycle with a deliberately pathological brief, or wait for a naturally-failing day.

## 2026-04-17: Beat navigation activated via rehype plugin, not Drafter output

**Context:** The `<lesson-shell>` / `<lesson-beat>` Web Components were fully built in Stage 2 — beat-by-beat navigation, prev/next, progress bar, session resume, server sync, engagement tracking — but dormant. DrafterAgent was emitting plain markdown (`## hook`, `## what-is-hormuz`) rather than the wrapper tags described in the original spec, so every daily piece rendered as one continuous wall of prose. The reader's primary surface was quietly broken.

**Decision:** Add a small rehype plugin (`src/lib/rehype-beats.ts`, ≤ 120 lines) that walks the MDX HAST tree, splits the document at `h2` boundaries, and wraps each section in `<lesson-beat name="{slug}">` inside a single `<lesson-shell>`. The plugin also humanises kebab-case headings for display (`what-is-hormuz` → `What Is Hormuz`). No agent changes.

**Why a render-time transform instead of changing Drafter:**
- Agent pipeline stays untouched — the voice contract, prompt library, and audit gates are all validated against the existing output format. Touching Drafter risks regressions on output the audit layer has been tuned for.
- Retroactive: every past piece, including the in-tree Hormuz example, benefits immediately. No re-publishing.
- Safe fallback: if an MDX file has no `h2` headings (legacy or intro-only pieces), the plugin is a no-op and the page renders as regular prose.
- Progressive enhancement preserved: without JS the wrapped structure still reads as a long document.

**Tradeoff accepted:** Drafter can continue emitting `## slug-style` headings forever. We're treating those markdown headings as a structural seam the build knows how to cut along. If we later want richer beat metadata (duration, media, pull quote), we move that into frontmatter `beats:` rather than teaching the Drafter to emit XML.

**Verified:** `npm run build` produces 7 `<lesson-beat>` elements for the Hormuz test piece; beat-by-beat navigation, keyboard arrows, progress bar, and finish-redirect all work in the static preview.

## 2026-04-17: Soften quality surfacing — tier over filter

**Context:** The "publish-anyway" work (decision above) kept the daily cadence by publishing low-quality pieces but then hid them — filtered out of `/library/`, `/daily/`, the homepage "From the library" strip, and every dashboard archive query. On the direct URL the piece rendered behind a yellow banner that said *"This one didn't fully pass our voice, structure, and fact checks."* Two problems: (1) hiding a published piece contradicts the transparency brand (the dashboard is literally the "factory floor"); (2) the scolding language — "Failed" in red on the public dashboard, "LOW QUALITY" labels, the apologetic banner — treated a 78/85 piece as a disgrace rather than what it is: slightly below bar but readable. Zishan's call: treat every published piece equally, show a quiet tier instead of filtering, stop bragging or apologising.

**Decision:** Three-tier reader-facing label, derived from voice score:
- `polished` — voiceScore ≥ 85 (passes the voice bar)
- `solid` — 70 ≤ voiceScore < 85 (below bar, readable)
- `rough` — voiceScore < 70 (noticeably below, still published)

Fallback when `voiceScore` is missing: default to `polished`, unless `qualityFlag === 'low'` (then `rough`). Helper in `src/lib/audit-tier.ts`.

Changes:
1. New `voiceScore` field in MDX frontmatter + content schema. Director splices it on every publish (not just failures) alongside the conditional `qualityFlag`.
2. Removed `quality_flag IS NULL` / `qualityFlag !== 'low'` filters from every reader-facing query: `/library/`, `/daily/`, homepage, `/api/dashboard/recent`, `/api/dashboard/stats`, and the dashboard page's 4 D1 queries. Counts and lists now reflect reality.
3. Deleted the yellow banner on `/daily/[date]/`. Tier appears instead as a single quiet word in the existing metadata line (`8 min · 6 beats · Business · Solid`) — same `text-zee-muted` tone as the rest of the line, no colour change.
4. Public dashboard `Quality Scores` grid softened: Voice card shows the tier word (`Polished`/`Solid`/`Rough`), not `Passing`/`Failed`; Facts/Structure use `Passing`/`Mixed`. No red anywhere — neutral progress bars.
5. Dashboard footer updated — old line claimed *"No piece publishes without passing all three"* which is no longer true.
6. Admin surface (`/dashboard/admin/`) intentionally unchanged — operators still see `Voice: 78/100`, `LOW QUALITY` labels in the pipeline monitor, failed-gate detail. Raw truth for the factory floor.

**Kept as-is:** `quality_flag` column on `daily_pieces`, `qualityFlag` in MDX schema, Director still writes both. Non-destructive per project convention, useful as a secondary signal in the tier helper, and preserves optionality for future admin tooling.

**Reason:** Transparency is the brand. Treating one published piece as unworthy of the archive is the opposite of "educate myself for humble decisions" — it's the system hiding its own shortcomings. The tier lets a reader calibrate without being scolded, and the consistent treatment (every piece shows its tier) means the word `rough` isn't a warning singled-out on weak days — it's just information, same as the read time.

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean, content schema accepts new `voiceScore` field. Today's piece (2026-04-17, QVC) renders as `Rough` via the `qualityFlag: low` fallback path without a manual voice score backfill. Library, daily index, and homepage include it chronologically. Yellow banner gone.

## 2026-04-17: Avg voice score aggregated from `daily_pieces.voice_score`, not `audit_results`

**Context:** After the soften-quality pass (commit 80ebe10) every public surface was switched from `quality_flag IS NULL` filtering to "every published piece counts". Two queries were missed — `voiceAgg` in `src/pages/dashboard/index.astro` and `avgVoice` in `src/pages/api/dashboard/stats.ts`. Both still read from `audit_results` with `WHERE auditor = 'voice' AND passed = 1`, which excludes every piece scoring below the 85 voice bar. Today's piece scored 78 → `passed = 0` → excluded → Avg voice card rendered `—` despite a real score existing on the piece page. Secondary issue: even with the filter removed, aggregating over `audit_results` double-counts every revision round.

**Decision:** Aggregate from `daily_pieces.voice_score` instead.

```sql
SELECT AVG(voice_score) AS avg, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM daily_pieces
WHERE voice_score IS NOT NULL;
```

**Reason:**
- `daily_pieces` has exactly one row per published piece.
- Director writes `lastVoiceScore` there on every publish (`agents/src/director.ts:263-268`), so the value is the final-round score — the same number the reader sees and the same number `auditTier()` uses to derive the tier word.
- `WHERE voice_score IS NOT NULL` cleanly excludes historical pieces from before the plumbing landed.
- Same table already backs `totalPieces` and `subjects`, so the avg now lives in the same semantic universe as its neighbours on the Library stats strip.

The API endpoint also now returns `voiceSampleSize` alongside `avgVoiceScore` so external consumers get the same honesty the dashboard UI already shows ("from N pieces").

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean; local static build; live deploy confirms dashboard renders a number and "from N pieces" subtitle.

## 2026-04-18: "How this was made" surfaced as a drawer on each piece, not a page

**Context:** Transparency is the brand (CLAUDE.md). Before today, a reader saw only the finished piece — the machinery behind it (13 agents, audit scores, voice-contract rules, rejected candidates, revision rounds) was invisible. The user asked for a complete transparency surface readers can open on any piece.

**Decision:** Add a "How this was made" drawer that slides in from the right of the daily piece page. Not a dedicated `/daily/.../process/` route. Not a section expanded below the piece.

The open affordance is a full-width, quiet link-style row at the bottom of each piece. Clicking it opens a drawer with four sections: piece summary, timeline, per-round auditor output, rules applied, and the candidates Scanner surfaced. URL hash `#made` makes the drawer deep-linkable without a new route.

**Why a drawer, not a page:**
- Transparency lives *next* to the work, not behind a page-jump. A reader interested in "how was this made" is still interested in the piece itself; yanking them to a separate route breaks that thread.
- The drawer preserves scroll position on the piece. Close → you're back where you were, reading.
- One URL per piece keeps the library/daily routing model simple. Deep-links via `#made` work without new routes.

**Why it ships with only existing data, no DB or agent changes:**
- `pipeline_log` already has the full per-phase timeline (keyed by `run_id = YYYY-MM-DD`).
- `audit_results` already has per-round scores + violations / claims / issues (keyed by `task_id = daily/YYYY-MM-DD`, grouped by `draft_id`).
- `daily_candidates` already has the full Scanner candidate set.
- `daily_pieces` already has piece metadata + voice_score + quality_flag.
- Commit URL + file path are already written into the `publishing.done` step of `pipeline_log`.

Data that doesn't exist is explicitly not displayed: no reader visits (engagement isn't wired for daily pieces), no Curator reasoning (never stored), no intermediate drafts (not kept). The drawer hides sections whose data is empty rather than inventing placeholders.

**Shape of the fix:**
- New public endpoint `src/pages/api/daily/[date]/made.ts` aggregates the four tables above into one JSON envelope. Independent of the admin dashboard endpoints — simpler to consume than orchestrating three calls client-side.
- New `src/components/MadeBy.astro` renders the open button + drawer scaffold.
- New `src/interactive/made-drawer.ts` Web Component: open/close, focus trap, Escape to close, body scroll lock, URL hash sync, fetch-on-mount, render.
- New `src/styles/made.css` — standalone CSS, same pattern as `beats.css` / `zita.css` (avoids Tailwind purge).
- Rules card uses keyword matching between auditor violations and voice-contract rules — an honest, if imperfect, signal of which rules the audit flagged something adjacent to. Each rule "lights up" when a keyword from its list appears in any violation string.
- `src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts` extracted from `admin.astro` so admin + drawer share one step→label map and can't drift.

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean. Static preview: drawer opens, closes via button / Escape / backdrop, hash deep-link works. Full content requires D1 — confirmed live after deploy.

## 2026-04-18: Dashboard refocused on system-over-time, not per-piece

**Context:** The "How this was made" drawer (shipped earlier today) covers everything per-piece — timeline, audit rounds, rules, candidates. After it shipped, the public dashboard's most prominent sections (Today's Pipeline, Quality Scores, Recent Pieces) became duplicates of either the homepage hero or the drawer. The dashboard had no unique job.

**Decision:** Refocus the public dashboard on cross-piece, cross-day signals only. The drawer owns "how this piece was made"; the dashboard owns "how the factory is running over time".

**New structure:**
1. Page header (eyebrow / title / live subtitle: pieces published, days running, next-run countdown).
2. Today — one-line status strip (Published / Running / Pending), no fat card.
3. This week's output — 4 stat cards: pieces (week + lifetime), avg voice (week, lifetime fallback), tier mix (Polished·Solid·Rough), avg revision rounds.
4. Recent runs — vertical list of the last 7 days with tier dot, voice score, rounds, candidate count, headline; click → goes to that piece (which has the drawer).
5. How it's holding up — three honest signal rows: unresolved escalations (with context), fact-check web availability, avg candidates per day. Rows hide entirely if their data doesn't exist (no placeholder dashes).
6. Agent team — same 13 names, but the most recently active agent (last `pipeline_log` row within 24h) gets an ambient `● active Nm ago` marker.
7. How this works — short paragraph + Voice contract link. Admin Panel link appears here gated on isAdmin (moved from a prominent CTA at the top).

**Removed entirely:**
- Today's Pipeline fat card (drawer + homepage cover this).
- Quality Scores three-card grid (drawer covers per-round; the run log covers cross-piece).
- Recent Pieces simple list (replaced by the richer Recent Runs feed).
- Library 4-stat grid (merged into This week's output).
- Top-level Admin Panel button (moved to discreet footer link).

**Why these queries (all existing tables — no new schema):**
- Tier mix derives from `daily_pieces.voice_score` via `auditTier()` (already canonical).
- Avg rounds counts distinct `audit_results.draft_id` per task_id (suffix `-rN`).
- Unresolved escalations from `observer_events WHERE severity='escalation' AND acknowledged_at IS NULL`.
- Fact-check status counts last-7-days `observer_events WHERE severity='warn' AND title LIKE '%fact-check%'`.
- "Active agent" maps `pipeline_log` step name → agent via inline `STEP_TO_AGENT` table; only shown if the latest step is within 24h.

**Rationale:** Trust through specificity. The dashboard tells the truth at one piece (sample size shown) and at thirty pieces (week-vs-lifetime split). Empty sections vanish rather than show dashes. Every number is a thing the system actually knows.

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean. Static pages still 200. Dashboard requires D1 — verified post-deploy on the live worker.

## 2026-04-18: Site polish bundle — 404, OG meta, drawer lazy-load

**Context:** Post-dashboard-redesign audit found seven fixable rough edges. Shipped together as one quick-wins bundle.

### What landed
1. **Custom 404 page** (`src/pages/404.astro`) — replaces the default Astro dark/monospace 404. On-brand: gold eyebrow + "You've reached a dead end" title + three exit doors (today / library / dashboard).
2. **OG / Twitter sharing meta** (`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`) — full set of og:title / og:description / og:type / og:url / og:image / og:site_name + twitter:card + canonical link. Daily pieces pass `ogType="article"` and the piece description; everything else defaults to `"website"`. Requires `astro.config.mjs` to set `site` for absolute URL resolution.
3. **OG image** (`public/og-image.svg`) — typography-only branded card, 1200×630, cream + teal + gold. Same image for every page (per-piece dynamic OG is a separate project).
4. **Google Fonts preconnect** — added `<link rel="preconnect">` for both `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` (with crossorigin) before the font stylesheet load. ~50ms first-paint improvement.
5. **Library filter focus ring** — replaced `focus:ring-0` with `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-zee-primary/30 rounded`. Was an a11y regression — keyboard users had no focus indication on the filter input.
6. **Drawer lazy-load** (`src/interactive/made-drawer.ts` + `src/components/MadeBy.astro`) — `<made-drawer>` no longer fetches `/api/daily/[date]/made` on mount. Only on click or `#made` hash. Saves one D1 query per page view for readers who never open the drawer. Trade-off accepted: the button copy is now static ("The pipeline of 13 agents behind this piece") with no live audit-round count. Inside the drawer the reader sees real numbers.
7. **Dashboard mobile wrap** — "How it's holding up" rows now stack `flex-col` on small screens, revert to `sm:flex-row sm:justify-between` at 640px+. Fixes the awkward two-line wrap of "3 checks this week used Claude-only" at 375px.

### What was deferred (still real, just bigger)
- `public/_headers` exists with full CSP/HSTS but isn't being honored by the live response. Cloudflare Workers Static Assets uses a different mechanism — needs separate investigation.
- Login page styling refresh
- Zita panel rebrand (white → zee-bg)
- Per-piece dynamic OG image generation (Cloudflare Worker route)
- Skip-link / full WCAG audit

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean. Static preview confirmed: `/totally-fake/` renders custom 404; daily page no longer fires the made-API call on mount; drawer opens and fetches on click. Live verification post-deploy.

## 2026-04-18: Admin redesigned as a control room + per-piece deep-dive

**Context:** The admin page was a mix of broken (Recent Agent Tasks queried `agent_tasks`, dropped in migration 0008) and misleading (the 14-day Engagement table showed legacy lessons-era reader data, never daily-piece data). It also had no per-piece detail — operator could see today's pipeline and recent observer events, but couldn't click into any historical piece to see audit notes, candidates, or the day's events.

**Decision:** Rewrite admin as a control room. Add a per-piece deep-dive route. Refresh login to match the design system. All from existing data — no schema, no agent, no API changes.

**Admin (`src/pages/dashboard/admin.astro`)**:
- Page header: gold eyebrow ("THE CONTROL ROOM") + title + subtitle, matching account/dashboard.
- Today's run: trigger button + step-by-step pipeline log (existing functionality; refactored to share `pipelineStepLabel()` with the public dashboard and the per-piece drawer).
- System state: 4 stat cards — pipeline runs (lifetime), open escalations, errors this week, avg revisions.
- Observer events: same severity-coloured cards, but acknowledged-state now updates in-place (no page reload). Card softens, Acknowledge button removed.
- All pieces: every published piece, newest first, with tier dot + date + voice score + rounds + candidates count + low-flag indicator. Filter input shows when >5 pieces. Each row links to `/dashboard/admin/piece/{date}/`.
- Pipeline history: terminal step per run for the last 14 distinct runs, derived from `pipeline_log` with a single SQL window query.
- Engagement section replaced with an honest placeholder pointing to CLAUDE.md.
- Recent Agent Tasks table dropped (the table doesn't exist).

**Per-piece deep-dive (`src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro`, NEW)**:
- Same admin gate as `admin.astro`.
- Server-rendered, queries D1 directly — no new API endpoint.
- Sections: piece header (tier eyebrow, headline, all metadata, view-on-site + commit + source links), pipeline timeline (collapsed by step, each expandable to show full data JSON), audit rounds (full violations / claims / structure issues, no truncation, no "see more"), all candidates (no 6-cap), observer events for the day (36h window), raw data dumps for `daily_pieces` / `audit_results` / `pipeline_log` rows in collapsible `<details>` blocks.
- The reader-facing drawer caps `alsoConsidered` at 6 and parses violation strings; admin sees all 50 candidates and the raw notes JSON.

**Inline bug fix**: The `isRunning` heuristic on the public `/api/dashboard/pipeline` endpoint only checks step name, not status. Fixed on the consumer side in admin's polling: a run is only "running" if the latest row's `status === 'running'` AND its step is not in `['done', 'error', 'skipped']`. The API endpoint stays untouched (no other consumers verified safe).

**Login (`src/pages/login.astro`)**: Refreshed page header to match account/dashboard pattern (eyebrow + title + subtitle), wider container (`max-w-md` from `max-w-sm`), styled error/success notices in zee-* tokens instead of red/green Tailwind defaults, label uppercase-tracked. Magic-link form flow unchanged.

**Reused**: `auditTier()` + `auditTierLabel()` from `src/lib/audit-tier.ts`, `pipelineStepLabel()` from `src/lib/pipeline-steps.ts`, `getUser()` from `src/lib/db.ts`. Same divider-list + stat-card patterns used everywhere else.

**Verified**: `npm run build` clean. Live verification post-deploy with admin login.

## 2026-04-18: Director.onStart no longer cancels its own cron

**Context:** The 2am UTC run on 2026-04-18 never fired. `pipeline_log` for the day was empty; today's piece never produced. Yesterday's piece (2026-04-17) shipped only because it was a manual `/daily-trigger`. The cron has effectively never fired in production.

**Root cause:** The Agents SDK's `alarm()` handler calls `super.alarm()` *before* scanning `cf_agents_schedules` for due rows. `super.alarm()` triggers `#ensureInitialized()`, which runs `onStart()`. Director's `onStart()` was:

```ts
const existing = await this.getSchedules();
for (const s of existing) await this.cancelSchedule(s.id);
await this.schedule('0 2 * * *', 'dailyRun', { type: 'daily-piece' });
```

When the alarm woke the DO at 2am, `onStart()` deleted the cron row and re-inserted it. The new row's `time` is `getNextCronTime('0 2 * * *')` evaluated *after* 2am — i.e. tomorrow's 2am. The alarm body then queried `WHERE time <= now`, found nothing, and exited silently. Self-perpetuating: every 2am wake-up hits the same trap.

**Decision:** Drop the cancel loop. Cron schedules in the Agents SDK are idempotent on `(callback, cron, payload)` — repeated `schedule()` calls return the existing row instead of inserting. The cancel-then-recreate pattern was unnecessary defensive code that turned into the actual bug.

```ts
async onStart() {
  await this.schedule('0 2 * * *', 'dailyRun', { type: 'daily-piece' });
}
```

**Recovery:** Today's piece run manually from admin. Fix takes effect from tomorrow's 2am onward (after deploy).

**Why this slipped:** The cron path had never fired before. Yesterday was the first production day, and yesterday's piece was a manual trigger from the reset-today flow. Today's was meant to be the first true autonomous fire.

**Verified:** SDK source confirms idempotency at `agents/node_modules/agents/dist/index.js:1474` — cron path checks `WHERE type='cron' AND callback AND cron AND payload LIMIT 1`, returns existing row if found.

## 2026-04-19: First autonomous cron fire exposes three silent-failure bugs

**Context:** 2am UTC cron fired autonomously for the first time (the cron fix deployed 2026-04-18 worked). Pipeline produced a Polished piece — Voice 95/100, 1 round, 0 revisions, 50 candidates, committed at 02:01. But the first real auto-run also exposed three regressions that manual-trigger runs had been masking:

1. `/daily/2026-04-19/` rendered as one flowing prose block — no `<lesson-shell>`/`<lesson-beat>` slides, no Next/Previous, no pagination. 04-17 and 04-18 render correctly.
2. Auditor escalated at 02:01:48: *"No audio rows found for 2026-04-19 — producer did not run or persist failed."* Admin timeline misleadingly showed `audio-producing ✓`. Reader: "Audio version coming soon" indefinitely.
3. Dashboard "how it's holding up" surfaced *fact-check web: Offline — 5 checks this week used Claude-only*, meaning every Facts ✓ this week had silently degraded to first-pass Claude only.

**Diagnosis — bugs 1 and 2 are the same bug:** `agents/src/drafter-prompt.ts` lists beat names in the brief but never specifies how to demarcate them in the MDX body. Claude free-styled: 04-17 and 04-18 happened to use `## beat-name` markdown headings; 04-19 used `<beat id="beat-name">` custom JSX tags. Both are valid MDX. Two downstream consumers hard-code `##`:
- `src/lib/rehype-beats.ts:85` only wraps `h2` nodes into `<lesson-beat>`. Zero h2s → plugin no-ops at line 90 → flat prose.
- `agents/src/audio-producer.ts:145` `extractBeats()` splits on `/\n## /`. Zero matches → empty array → producer loops over nothing → returns "success" with no ElevenLabs calls and no D1 writes. Pipeline log gets `audio-producing ✓` regardless.

**Diagnosis — bug 3 is two bugs stacked:** The DDG Instant Answer API (`api.duckduckgo.com`) is a Wikipedia-topic oracle, not a general web search. Specific factual claims return HTTP 200 with empty `Abstract`/`RelatedTopics`. `fact-checker.ts:137-163` had a bare `catch { return null }` + `if (!response.ok) return null` that collapsed three distinct outcomes into a single nullable string. The "Web search unavailable" warn then fired for both actual network failures AND "DDG reached but had no answer" — conflating infrastructure health with question-specificity. No fetch timeout either.

**Decisions:**

1. **Drafter prompt mandates `##` syntax.** Added "Beat format (required)" section to `DRAFTER_PROMPT` with the `## beat-name` pattern, explicit forbiddance of JSX tags, and the *why* (downstream renderer + audio producer both split on `## `). One-line clarification at the root of both bugs 1 and 2.

2. **`extractBeats()` throws on zero beats.** Converts silent zero-row "success" into a visible escalation via Director's existing try/catch. The audio pipeline `✓` becomes `✗` with a real reason; Auditor's "no rows found" check becomes a backstop instead of the primary alarm.

3. **Fact-checker refactored to discriminated outcomes.** New `WebSearchOutcome` and `SearchPassOutcome` types encode `ok | empty | error`. `webSearch()` returns `{status: 'error', reason}` for unreachable/5xx/timeout, `{status: 'empty'}` for reachable-but-no-answer, `{status: 'ok', text}` otherwise. `check()` maps these to three honest combos of `FactCheckResult.{searchUsed, searchAvailable}`:
   - `both true` → pass-3 reassessment ran on real content
   - `searchAvailable: true, searchUsed: false` → DDG was reachable, had no relevant answer, first-pass Claude is the final word — **not** a quality regression, no Observer warn
   - `both false` → DDG unreachable, real infrastructure problem
   5-second `AbortSignal.timeout` added. The dashboard's *Fact-check web: Offline* signal is now truthful — it fires only on real network failure.

4. **Reset 04-19 rather than patch the MDX.** The committed body had `<beat>` tags — the permanence rule forbids content edits. Reset (git rm + D1 wipe across 6 tables) preserves the rule and lets the fixed Drafter produce a clean replacement.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Teach `rehype-beats.ts` to also accept `<beat>` tags.** Retroactively fixes 04-19 without MDX edit — tempting. Rejected: legitimising two valid syntaxes invites future Drafter drift and hides the real bug (prompt ambiguity). One syntax, enforced at source.
- **Replace DDG Instant Answer with Brave/Serper/Claude-web-search.** Correct long-term fix — DDG IA realistically resolves ~5% of specific factual claims. Scoped out of tonight's patch; logged in CLAUDE.md "Remaining minor items". Tonight's refactor at least makes the signal honest about the narrow coverage.
- **Enforce `beatCount` = actual `##` count via Structure-Editor gate.** Uncovered a data-integrity drift on 04-17 (declares 6, has 8 `##` headings). Reader UI counts actual headings so rendering is correct; only `daily_pieces.beat_count` is stale metadata. Also logged in minor items.

**Reason — why a prompt fix over making both consumers accept multiple syntaxes:** The contract Drafter owes downstream is *"one section per `##` heading, kebab-case slug."* Two consumers already enforce it. Loosening them (adding `<beat>` tolerance to either) multiplies the surface area of valid inputs and invites the next drift — `<section>`, `###`, `<div data-beat=...>`. One source of truth at the producer, not defensive tolerance at every consumer.

**Reason — why throw in `extractBeats()` rather than return an empty sentinel:** The 04-19 failure was invisible because the success signal (pipeline-log `✓`) was emitted from Director *after* a successful function return, regardless of whether that success had produced any rows. Throwing surfaces the real failure in Director's try/catch, which is already wired to Observer escalation. The old pattern meant the Auditor's "no rows found" check was the alarm — triggered ~60s downstream with a symptom ("no rows") instead of a root cause ("zero beats found in MDX"). The throw moves diagnosis upstream.

**Recovery:** Reset 04-19 (git rm MDX + D1 wipe 6 tables: `daily_pieces`, `daily_candidates`, `pipeline_log`, `audit_results`, `observer_events`, `daily_piece_audio`). User triggers fresh pipeline from admin. Fixed Drafter emits `##` syntax → rehype-beats produces `<lesson-beat>` slides → extractBeats returns 6 beats → audio-producer writes 6 rows → Publisher's second commit splices `audioBeats` into frontmatter → reader sees paginated slides + working audio.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` on agents/ — zero errors in touched files. `server.ts` pre-existing Durable Object stub type errors are unrelated and pre-date this change.

**References:** [agents/src/drafter-prompt.ts](../agents/src/drafter-prompt.ts), [agents/src/audio-producer.ts](../agents/src/audio-producer.ts), [agents/src/fact-checker.ts](../agents/src/fact-checker.ts), [src/lib/rehype-beats.ts](../src/lib/rehype-beats.ts). CLAUDE.md "Remaining minor items" now lists the DDG IA narrow-coverage limitation and the `beatCount` declared-vs-actual drift.

## 2026-04-19: Audio pipeline hardening — fetch timeout + Continue/Start-over retry UX

**Context:** After the first three-bug fix landed and 04-19 was re-triggered, text + beats published cleanly but audio stalled at 2 of 6 beats. Last row (`the-cost-structure`) persisted at 08:19:05 UTC; 18+ minutes later, `pipeline_log` still showed `audio-producing running`, no `done`, no `failed`, no observer escalation, and the admin page showed no retry button because the existing logic was a binary branch: *show rows if any exist, show retry button only if none exist.* Operator had partial state + zero way to act on it.

**Root cause:** `agents/src/audio-producer.ts` `callElevenLabs()` had no fetch timeout. When ElevenLabs stalled the TCP connection on beat 3 (likely rate limit or transient network glitch with no response), `fetch()` hung indefinitely. The Durable Object eventually hibernated, leaving Director's `await producer.generateAudio(...)` in limbo — no resolve, no reject. Same silent-failure pattern we'd just fixed in DDG fact-checker but never propagated to ElevenLabs.

Retry UI gap compounded the problem: partial rows are exactly when operators need a retry button most (the pipeline is stuck, not complete), but the existing template hid it.

**Decisions:**

1. **30-second `AbortSignal.timeout` on ElevenLabs fetch.** Matches the DDG fix pattern. Typical response for a 2000-char beat is 5-15s; 30s is generous headroom. On timeout, `fetch` rejects, existing 3-attempt retry loop in `callElevenLabs` fires (1s then 2s backoff), all 3 fail fast, exception bubbles up to Director's try/catch at `director.ts:336-346`, which logs `audio-producing failed` + emits an Observer escalation via `logAudioFailure`. Silent hang → visible escalation.

2. **`retryAudioFresh(date)` on Director.** Wipes R2 objects (`list({prefix: audio/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/}) → delete` each), `daily_piece_audio` rows, `daily_pieces.has_audio`, and `pipeline_log` rows matching `step LIKE 'audio%'`. Then delegates to existing `retryAudio(date)` for MDX read + pipeline re-run. Text-phase pipeline rows (scanning/curating/drafting/auditing/publishing/done) are preserved — they describe a piece that remains published. Only audio-side state is reset.

3. **`/audio-retry` endpoint accepts `mode=continue|fresh` query param** (default `continue` for backwards compatibility with any external callers). Site proxy at `src/pages/api/agents/audio-retry.ts` passes through.

4. **Admin UI rework** at `src/pages/dashboard/admin/piece/[date].astro`. New completion signal: `piece.has_audio === 1`. Whenever that's false, retry affordance is visible. When partial rows exist, TWO buttons appear: **Continue** (default `mode=continue`, resumes missing beats) and **Start over** (`mode=fresh`, confirm() dialog stating the clip count that will be deleted + cost, then wipe-and-regenerate). Row listing and retry affordance stack vertically instead of being mutually exclusive — operator sees current state AND has an action.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Per-beat retry buttons (regenerate just this one clip).** Rejected — adds UI complexity for a rare need. If one beat's audio is bad, Start over with six cheap ElevenLabs calls is simpler than per-row targeting, and production traffic is low enough that the extra cost is negligible.
- **Double-click-to-confirm on Start over instead of browser confirm() dialog.** Cleaner visual feel but needs state management for the 3-second arm window. Browser `confirm()` is zero-JS-state, explicit about consequences (clip count in the message), and idiomatic for destructive admin actions.
- **Auto-retry on stall (detect `audio-producing running` > 5min and re-fire).** Rejected for now — adds a polling/watchdog dimension to the system. The new timeout on ElevenLabs fetch should prevent stalls in the first place; if they still happen, operator gets a visible retry button. Revisit if stalls recur despite the timeout.

**Reason — why the timeout is a 30s per-attempt and not a smaller outer deadline:** ElevenLabs latency varies by text length and server load. 5-15s typical, occasionally 20-25s for long beats. A 10s timeout would false-positive frequently. 30s gives headroom for normal variance but still fails fast if the connection is truly stuck.

**Reason — why `retryAudioFresh` wipes before delegating instead of having `runAudioPipeline` take a `reset` flag:** Keeps the pipeline method free of mode branching. `runAudioPipeline` should only know how to produce + audit + publish given fresh input; the "is this a fresh attempt or a resume" decision belongs at the caller. Cleaner separation.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` on agents/ — zero new errors in touched files. The server.ts DurableObjectStub noise that flags `retryAudioFresh` is the same pre-existing pattern that flags `retryAudio`, `getStatus`, `triggerDailyPiece`, etc. Runtime is unaffected.

## 2026-04-19: Audio RPC wall-clock budget — chunked generation

**Context:** After Phase D fixes (ElevenLabs timeout + retry UI + retryAudioFresh) deployed and 04-19 was re-triggered, audio again stalled at exactly 2 of 6 beats. Hit **Continue** once → 2→4. Hit it again → 4→6. Pattern made the root cause crisp:

| Run | Beat 1 | Beat 2 | Elapsed |
|---|---|---|---|
| First autonomous | 08:18:47 | 08:19:05 | ~18s |
| First retrigger | 09:14:08 | 09:14:20 | ~12s |
| Continue click 1 | N/A | N/A | ~20s, +2 beats |
| Continue click 2 | N/A | N/A | ~15s, +2 beats |

Each producer invocation cleared ~2 beats in ~20-25s then silently died — no error logged, no observer escalation, no pipeline_log `failed` row. The 30s AbortSignal.timeout we added in Phase D wasn't the culprit: individual ElevenLabs calls completed in 10-15s. The **outer RPC call** from Director → Producer was the thing hitting a ~30s wall-clock budget.

**Root cause:** Cloudflare Durable Object RPC calls are bounded by a wall-clock budget (~30 seconds) before the platform considers them stuck and terminates/hibernates the callee. When producer's `generateAudio(brief, mdx)` ran a for-loop over 6 beats × ~10-15s each of ElevenLabs latency, total wall time was 60-90s — well over budget. Cloudflare silently killed the DO; the pending promise in Director's `await` never resolved. Every symptom tonight — silent hang, no error, admin UI showing partial state indefinitely — traces back to this single budget.

**Decision:** Chunk the producer work. Rename + refactor `generateAudio()` to `generateAudioChunk(brief, mdx, maxBeats = 2)` — processes at most N new beats per call, returns `{processedBeats, totalBeats, completedCount, totalCharacters}`. Director's `runAudioPipeline` replaces the single `await producer.generateAudio(...)` with a bounded while-loop (≤10 iterations) calling `generateAudioChunk` until `completedCount >= totalBeats`. Each call runs for ≤25s (2 beats × ~12s + overhead), comfortably under the RPC budget. All remaining state (auditor, publisher second-commit) is unchanged — they already read from D1.

**Chunk size chosen = 2:** Safe margin under the 30s budget even at ElevenLabs' slow end (2 × 15s = 30s + overhead is risky; 2 × 12s = 24s + overhead fits). Could raise to 3 but no reason to — the loop cost is negligible.

**Cross-chunk prosodic continuity:** ElevenLabs stitches audio across calls via `previous_request_ids` (up to 3 prior request IDs per call). In the old single-call version, this lived in an in-memory array that survived because the whole loop was one DO invocation. Across chunks, that array is gone on each new call. **Fix:** at the start of each chunk, query `daily_piece_audio` for the last 3 non-null `request_id`s by `generated_at DESC`, reverse to oldest-first, use those as the seed `previous_request_ids`. The stitching works unchanged across chunk boundaries — listeners can't tell the audio was generated in 3 calls instead of 1.

**Publisher reads audioBeats map from D1, not from Director's in-memory accumulation.** D1 is the only source of truth that covers (a) all beats from the current run's chunks, (b) any beats carried over from a prior partial run via R2 head-check skip. In-memory accumulation in Director would miss case (b) if a retry happened to land on Continue after a partial.

**Safety belts in Director's while-loop:**
- `MAX_CHUNK_ITERATIONS = 10` — hard ceiling on loop reruns; for a 20k-char piece at 2 beats/chunk, ≤6 iterations is expected; throws at 10 to prevent runaway cost
- `processedBeats.length === 0 && completedCount < totalBeats` → no progress → throw (prevents infinite loops if producer silently refuses work)

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Use DO alarm() to chain beat generation.** Producer schedules an alarm to fire in ~2s which picks up the next beat, continues until done, sets a "complete" state that Director polls. Rejected — adds state machine complexity (alarm scheduling, completion polling, timeout detection) for no real benefit over the cleaner synchronous loop. Also leaks "running" state if Director's polling side dies.
- **Use Cloudflare Queues between Director and Producer.** Over-engineered for a sequential 6-step pipeline. Queues are for decoupling async consumers, not orchestrating a deterministic sequence.
- **Use `ctx.waitUntil` on the producer side to return early + continue in background.** Changes the RPC contract (caller gets back instantly without results) and introduces the same polling + completion-detection complexity as the alarm approach. Rejected for the same reasons.
- **Put the loop inside the producer (use ctx.waitUntil + multiple inner RPCs).** Same wall-clock budget still applies to the outer producer RPC; just shifts the problem.

**Reason — why a bounded loop rather than "just keep calling until done":** A runaway loop could spend unbounded ElevenLabs credits if producer gets into a weird state where beats look unprocessed but can't be generated. `MAX_CHUNK_ITERATIONS = 10` is roughly 2× the expected ceiling for the largest piece we'd ship (12 beats × 2 per chunk = 6 iterations), so legitimate work always succeeds but a bug never costs more than ~$1 of credits before escalating.

**Reason — why not just do 1 beat per chunk:** Each chunk has fixed overhead (subAgent lookup, D1 queries for priorRequestIds + countRow, return-trip latency). Doing 1 beat per chunk means 6 chunks of overhead. 2 per chunk halves that; 3 would start flirting with the 30s budget at ElevenLabs' slow end. 2 is the Pareto sweet spot.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors in touched files. `pnpm build` — site build passes. End-to-end verification pending reset + re-trigger.

## 2026-04-19: DO eviction was the real root cause (not a per-RPC budget) — keepAlive() fix

**Context:** Phase F chunking made the producer robust but didn't fix the underlying stall. After Phase F deployed, next trigger stalled at **1/5 beats** — even worse than the 2/6 we'd seen before. Only explanation: the problem wasn't at the producer-RPC level. Going back to the pipeline_log timestamps told the real story:

```
scanning      0s  → done 2s      (Scanner)
curating      2s  → done 30s     (Curator, 28s — Claude call)
drafting      30s → done 78s     (Drafter, 48s — Claude generates ~1300 words)
auditing_r1   78s → done 106s    (three auditors in parallel)
publishing    106s → done 107s   (GitHub commit)
done          107s
audio-producing 108s → running
  └─ hook beat generated at 116s (8s into audio)
  └─ silence after 116s
```

Director's Durable Object ran for 116 seconds and died. The text phase alone consumed 107s of that. Audio only got 9 seconds before the DO was evicted.

**Root cause (found, not guessed):** Grepping the Agents SDK source at `agents/node_modules/agents/dist/index.js` for timeout/hibernation code surfaced the `keepAlive()` method docstring:

> *"Use this when you have long-running work and need to prevent the DO from going idle (**eviction after ~70-140s of inactivity**). The heartbeat fires every `keepAliveIntervalMs` (default 30s) via the alarm system."*

This is a documented Agents SDK feature, not a Cloudflare platform limit. Without `keepAlive()`, the runtime considers a long-running DO "inactive" after ~70-140s and hibernates it — killing any in-flight awaits including cross-facet RPC chains. The exact 70-140s range is why we saw stalls in that window consistently. The reason the Continue button worked is that `/audio-retry` kicks off a fresh HTTP request → fresh Director invocation → fresh 70-140s window, which gave audio enough budget to do 2 more beats before hitting the window again.

**Decision:** Wrap `Director.triggerDailyPiece`, `retryAudio`, and `retryAudioFresh` with `await this.keepAlive()` + `try/finally` disposer. The SDK's keepAlive uses the alarm system to fire a 30s heartbeat that resets the inactivity timer. Reference-counted internally, so nested calls (`retryAudioFresh` → `retryAudio`) are safe and the heartbeat only stops once all refs are disposed.

```ts
async triggerDailyPiece(force = false) {
  const dispose = await this.keepAlive();
  try {
    // full pipeline body — text + audio
  } finally {
    dispose();
  }
}
```

**What Phase F chunking still buys us (not wasted work):**

1. **Retry semantics are cleaner.** `generateAudioChunk(maxBeats=2)` processes bounded work per call. A retry resumes exactly where prior runs left off via R2 head-check; no infinite loops on weird state.
2. **Cross-chunk prosodic continuity via D1.** Loading the last 3 `request_id`s from `daily_piece_audio` at chunk start means ElevenLabs stitching works across multiple retries, not just within one invocation's in-memory window.
3. **Safer per-RPC budget.** Even with `keepAlive`, Agents SDK's client-side RPC timeout default is 60s. Chunked calls stay well under that regardless of DO inactivity.
4. **Progress is visible sooner.** Each chunk persists rows incrementally, so the admin dashboard reflects progress during generation instead of all-or-nothing at the end.

**Why I misdiagnosed it in Phase F:**

Pattern matched "30s Cloudflare RPC timeout" — a known Cloudflare limit I'd seen mentioned in platform docs. The 2/6-beat ceiling and the ~25s elapsed time both fit. But the correlation wasn't causation: the real signal was the **total Director invocation wall-clock**, not the producer-RPC-call duration. Chunking addressed the symptom (per-producer-call stays short) without fixing the cause (Director's surrounding invocation times out). 1/5 on the next trigger — worse than 2/6 — was the data point that broke the hypothesis and forced me to actually read the SDK source.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Split audio into a separate HTTP request after text completes.** Would give audio its own fresh Director invocation (same trick the Continue button uses). Rejected: more moving parts than `keepAlive()`, and still needs `keepAlive()` for pieces whose audio alone runs past 140s (12-beat newspapers).
- **Use DO alarms to chain audio chunks.** Each alarm fire is a fresh invocation. Rejected same reason — adds orchestration complexity (state machine, completion detection, timeout handling) when a single SDK method call does the same thing cleaner.
- **Static options `keepAliveIntervalMs: 20000`** (tighter heartbeat). Rejected — 30s default is fine; the eviction timer is 70-140s, so 30s heartbeats have 40-110s of slack. Changing it adds config surface without improving reliability.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean in touched files; `pnpm build` passes. End-to-end verification via reset + fresh trigger next.

**Lesson for next time:** When empirical pattern-matching gives a plausible story that fits the symptoms, resist the urge to ship without verifying against the SDK/platform source. The 30s RPC timeout story was plausible enough to waste a deploy cycle. Ten minutes of grepping `node_modules/agents/dist/` would have surfaced `keepAlive()` immediately.

## 2026-04-19: Audio via alarm, not inline (keepAlive was a partial fix)

**Context:** Phase G added `keepAlive()` based on the Agents SDK docstring *"eviction after ~70-140s of inactivity"*. Next trigger still stalled at 2/5 beats after 117s. keepAlive wasn't helping. Asked a research agent to pull **actual Cloudflare docs** instead of continuing to guess.

**What the docs actually say** (quoted from [Cloudflare DO limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/) and [Workers platform limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/)):

- HTTP/RPC-triggered DO invocations: *"If you consume more than 30 seconds of compute between incoming network requests, there is a heightened chance that the individual Durable Object is evicted and reset."* **There is no hard wall-clock limit** while the caller stays connected — but the "30s of compute between incoming requests" eviction rule kills long-running inline work.
- **Alarm handlers: "maximum wall time of 15 minutes."** They are a separate invocation boundary with their own fresh budget.
- **CPU budget: 30s default, up to 5 minutes via `limits.cpu_ms`.** CPU time excludes I/O waits (fetch, KV, D1), so our ElevenLabs-heavy audio phase burns almost no CPU — CPU wasn't the blocker.
- `keepAlive()` uses alarm-system heartbeats to simulate "incoming network requests" and reset the inactivity timer. But **Durable Objects are single-threaded**: alarms can't fire while the current invocation is holding the DO. So during a long inline method call, queued heartbeats can't actually deliver — they pile up waiting for the current call to finish, exactly when we need them.

**Root cause (definitive):** Our `triggerDailyPiece` runs inline from an HTTP-triggered invocation. Text phase: ~90s. Audio starts: ~2s of compute per beat × 5 beats = ~10s CPU with ~60s wall (ElevenLabs I/O). Cumulative compute-between-requests hits the ~30s eviction threshold midway through audio, and since no new HTTP request arrives during the whole pipeline, the DO gets reset. keepAlive heartbeats can't fire because the DO is busy running triggerDailyPiece. Whole invocation dies silently around 110-120s.

**Decision:** Move audio out of the HTTP-triggered invocation entirely. After text publishes, `triggerDailyPiece` calls `await this.schedule(1, 'runAudioPipelineScheduled', { date, filePath, title })` and returns. Schedule row is persisted in SQLite, alarm fires 1 second later in a **fresh DO invocation with up to 15 minutes of wall time**. Audio runs comfortably under that budget (6 beats × 15s ≈ 90s).

New method: `runAudioPipelineScheduled(payload)` — receives payload from the SDK scheduler, re-reads committed MDX from GitHub (keeps scheduled payloads small), calls existing `runAudioPipeline`. If MDX is missing (piece was deleted), logs an observer failure and exits cleanly.

Same change applied to `retryAudio`: validates inputs synchronously (so admin sees bad-date errors immediately), then schedules the audio work on an alarm. `retryAudioFresh` cascades through `retryAudio` so it inherits the schedule.

**Why Phase F and Phase G aren't wasted work:**

- **Phase F chunking** still lets the producer resume cleanly from partial prior runs via R2 head-check skip. Safer retry semantics, cross-chunk `request_id` stitching from D1.
- **Phase G keepAlive** stays on `triggerDailyPiece` + `retryAudioFresh`. Not the primary mechanism, but harmless; it protects shorter stretches of work (text phase alone is ~107s) and costs nothing when the DO isn't near the eviction boundary.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **`keepAliveWhile` helper + longer CPU limits.** Research agent suggested using `keepAliveWhile` instead of manual try/finally. Same result — still bound by the "compute between incoming requests" rule even if CPU is raised to 5min via `limits.cpu_ms`. The rule is about incoming request cadence, not CPU budget.
- **Split audio into per-beat alarms** (one alarm per beat). Overkill — single alarm invocation has 15 minutes, more than enough for 12 beats. Adds scheduling overhead without benefit.
- **Have `/audio-retry` call the alarm handler directly via fetch.** The SDK's `schedule()` does this cleanly already; no reason to reinvent it.
- **Use `runFiber` for automatic checkpointing + recovery.** Tempting (it uses `keepAlive` + `cf_agents_runs` for resumable work) but adds complexity we don't need — our audio work is already resumable via R2 head-check skip. Save `runFiber` for work with non-idempotent state.

**Reason — why we hit this specifically for audio and not text:** Text phase's work is dominated by Claude API calls via the Anthropic SDK, each of which is one outbound fetch. Between calls, Director does short logic (parse response, log step). The pattern of "call → await → short sync work → next call" keeps the DO regularly yielding, and Cloudflare's eviction heuristic apparently gives leeway to that shape. Audio's work is dominated by ElevenLabs fetches + R2 puts + D1 inserts — similar shape, but by the time audio starts, we've already burned most of the compute-between-requests budget on text. The issue is cumulative, not about audio being structurally different.

**Lesson for next time:** When a platform behavior doesn't match a plausible reading of the SDK docs, pull the actual platform docs before shipping another fix. Two wrong fixes (Phase F chunking, Phase G keepAlive) preceded the one that reads the platform limits page. Total cost: two CI cycles and one user retry cycle. Verifying the platform doc would have taken 5 minutes.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `pnpm build` passes. End-to-end verification in Phase H.5 via reset + fresh trigger.

**VERIFIED (2026-04-19 ~10:30 UTC):** Post-deploy trigger ran end-to-end in one shot. Text phase published cleanly (Voice 92/100, 1 round, 0 revisions, 6 beats, *"Why Jet Fuel Price Spikes Break Some Airlines and Not Others"*). Audio ran from the scheduled alarm invocation: generated all 6 beats totalling 9,299 characters, auditor passed, `publishAudio` committed the `audioBeats` frontmatter map (commit `6fd4466`), `has_audio = 1`. Live `/daily/2026-04-19/` shows a working `<audio-player>` (not "coming soon") + beat navigation. **Zero Continue clicks required.**

One informational artefact in the pipeline timeline: `audio-producing ✗ Durable Object reset because its code was updated.` followed immediately by a retry that succeeded. This was a deploy-during-scheduled-alarm race — the Phase H deploy propagated to the live worker between `schedule(1, ...)` and alarm fire. Cloudflare reset the DO to load the new code, the Agents SDK's scheduled-task retry absorbed the reset, second fire succeeded. Future runs (autonomous 2am UTC or manual triggers against stable code) won't show this — it's a lifecycle event tied specifically to mid-flight deploys. Also a nice demonstration that the alarm-based path is resilient to DO resets in a way the old inline path wasn't.

Post-verification cleanup: all 11 unacknowledged observer_events (3 stale escalations from 04-17/04-18 before tonight's fixes + 4 fact-check-web warnings + 4 audio-published infos) acknowledged in bulk. Dashboard inbox is clean.
