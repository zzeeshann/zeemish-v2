# Zeemish v2 — Decision Log

Append-only. Never edit old entries.

## 2026-04-16: Chose pnpm over npm
**Context:** Setting up the repo.
**Decision:** Use pnpm for package management.
**Reason:** Faster installs, strict dependency resolution, saves disk space. Recommended in the build guide.

## 2026-04-16: Astro output mode set to `static`
**Context:** Configuring Astro for Cloudflare deployment.
**Decision:** Use `output: 'static'` (not `server` or `hybrid`).
**Reason:** Stage 1 is a static site — no server-side rendering needed yet. Static is cheaper, faster, and simpler on Cloudflare. We'll switch to `hybrid` or `server` only when we need server-side routes (Stage 3).

## 2026-04-16: Zeemish brand colours as Tailwind theme
**Context:** Setting up Tailwind config.
**Decision:** Added `zee-bg`, `zee-text`, `zee-accent` as custom Tailwind colours.
**Reason:** Keeps the colour palette consistent across components. DM Sans set as default sans font to match brand.

## 2026-04-16: Handoff docs stored in docs/handoff/
**Context:** Planning documents from the architecture phase.
**Decision:** Copy all handoff docs into the repo at `docs/handoff/`.
**Reason:** Every future Claude Code session needs access to the architecture and build guide. Keeping them in the repo means no dependency on external file paths.

## 2026-04-16: Beats as Web Components, not Astro components
**Context:** Stage 2 — deciding how to build beat navigation.
**Decision:** Use native Web Components (`<lesson-shell>`, `<lesson-beat>`) for beat navigation.
**Reason:** Beat navigation requires client-side state (show/hide on click). Astro components are build-time only. Web Components give us progressive enhancement (all beats visible without JS) and zero framework dependency.

## 2026-04-16: Single Astro Worker instead of separate site + API workers
**Context:** Stage 3 — deciding whether to build a separate `worker/` API project.
**Decision:** Keep API routes inside Astro using `src/pages/api/` with the Cloudflare adapter.
**Reason:** Avoids CORS complexity, keeps one deploy target, simpler to develop. The architecture planned three workers but Astro handles both static and server routes natively. Can split later if scale demands it.

## 2026-04-16: PBKDF2 via Web Crypto API for password hashing
**Context:** Stage 3 — choosing a password hashing approach for Cloudflare Workers.
**Decision:** Use PBKDF2 (100k iterations, SHA-256) via the Web Crypto API.
**Reason:** Works natively in Workers runtime — no npm dependencies needed. bcrypt/argon2 would require WASM or npm packages. PBKDF2 with sufficient iterations is NIST-approved and adequate for our use case.

## 2026-04-16: Middleware only on server-rendered routes
**Context:** Stage 3 — Astro middleware was crashing on prerendered pages.
**Decision:** Auth middleware checks the URL path and only runs on `/api/`, `/account`, `/login` routes.
**Reason:** Prerendered pages don't have access to D1 at build time. The middleware creates anonymous users in D1, which can only run on server-rendered routes. Lesson pages call the API from the client side instead.
