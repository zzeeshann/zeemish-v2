# Zeemish v2 — Decision Log

Append-only. Never edit old entries.

## 2026-04-16: Chose pnpm over npm
**Context:** Setting up the repo.
**Decision:** Use pnpm for package management.
**Reason:** Faster installs, strict dependency resolution, saves disk space. Recommended in the build guide.

## 2026-04-16: Astro output mode set to `static`
**Context:** Configuring Astro for Cloudflare deployment.
**Decision:** Use `output: 'static'` (not `server` or `hybrid`).
**Reason:** Stage 1 is a static site — no server-side rendering needed yet. Static is cheaper, faster, and simpler on Cloudflare. We'll switch to `hybrid` or `server` only when we need server-side routes (Stage 3).

## 2026-04-16: Zeemish brand colours as Tailwind theme
**Context:** Setting up Tailwind config.
**Decision:** Added `zee-bg`, `zee-text`, `zee-accent` as custom Tailwind colours.
**Reason:** Keeps the colour palette consistent across components. DM Sans set as default sans font to match brand.

## 2026-04-16: Handoff docs stored in docs/handoff/
**Context:** Planning documents from the architecture phase.
**Decision:** Copy all handoff docs into the repo at `docs/handoff/`.
**Reason:** Every future Claude Code session needs access to the architecture and build guide. Keeping them in the repo means no dependency on external file paths.
