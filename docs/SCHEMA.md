## Reader-side tables

### users
Every visitor — anonymous and authenticated. Created on first API call.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID, generated on first visit |
| email | TEXT UNIQUE | Null for anonymous users, added on upgrade |
| password_hash | TEXT | PBKDF2 hash, null for anonymous |
| created_at | INTEGER | Unix timestamp ms |
| updated_at | INTEGER | Unix timestamp ms |

Migration: `0001_init.sql`

### progress
Tracks which beat a reader is on and which lessons they've completed.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| user_id | TEXT FK→users | |
| course_slug | TEXT | e.g. "body" |
| lesson_number | INTEGER | e.g. 1 |
| current_beat | TEXT | e.g. "teaching-1", null if not started or completed |
| completed_at | INTEGER | Unix timestamp ms, null if not finished |
| created_at | INTEGER | |
| updated_at | INTEGER | |

PK: (user_id, course_slug, lesson_number). Migration: `0001_init.sql`

### submissions
Optional practice data (breathing timer results, etc.).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| user_id | TEXT FK→users | |
| course_slug | TEXT | |
| lesson_number | INTEGER | |
| practice_type | TEXT | e.g. "breathing" |
| data | TEXT | JSON blob |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Migration: `0001_init.sql`

### zita_messages
Conversation history for the Zita learning guide.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| user_id | TEXT FK→users | |
| course_slug | TEXT | |
| lesson_number | INTEGER | |
| role | TEXT | "user" or "assistant" |
| content | TEXT | Message text |
| created_at | INTEGER | |
| piece_date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD of the `daily_pieces` row this conversation is about. Nullable at schema level so migration 0013 applied non-destructively to 92 pre-existing rows (backfilled via commented one-time UPDATEs in the migration file). Application layer (Commit B of Phase 1) enforces non-null for `course_slug='daily'` requests; lessons-course path still works with piece_date=null. Indexed via `idx_zita_piece(user_id, piece_date)`. Primary read paths: scoped history load in `/api/zita/chat`, per-piece admin view, P1.5 synthesis by piece. |
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID) this conversation is about. Added migration 0014 (cadence Phase 1) so Phase 6's Zita re-scoping can target a specific piece when multiple share a date. Nullable at schema level; backfilled from `piece_date → daily_pieces.date → daily_pieces.id` for the 92 migration-0013 rows. Indexed via `idx_zita_piece_id`. `piece_date` stays alongside for now — Phase 6 will deprecate the date-scoped SELECT in favour of piece_id. |

Migrations: `0001_init.sql` (initial), `0013_zita_messages_piece_date.sql` (added `piece_date`), `0014_piece_id_fks.sql` (added `piece_id`).

## Agent-side tables

### observer_events
What Zishan should know about — published lessons, escalations, errors.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| severity | TEXT | info, warn, escalation |
| title | TEXT | Short summary |
| body | TEXT | Markdown detail |
| context | TEXT | JSON with task IDs, scores, etc. |
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` for piece-scoped events (Published, Audio*, Reflection, Learner, etc.). NULL for system events (admin_settings_changed, zita_rate_limited, global errors) and legacy pre-0020 rows. Per-piece admin query prefers piece_id match; falls back to 36h day-of-publish window for legacy NULL rows. Added in migration 0020 (2026-04-22). |
| acknowledged_at | INTEGER | Null until Zishan acknowledges |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Migrations: `0002_observer_events.sql`, `0020_observer_events_piece_id.sql`

### engagement
Reader engagement metrics, aggregated per piece per day.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| piece_id | TEXT NOT NULL | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID). Primary attribution axis since migration 0017. For non-daily content, lesson-shell falls back to the old lesson_id semantics; for daily pieces, sourced from `<lesson-shell data-piece-id>` (injected by rehype-beats from MDX frontmatter). |
| lesson_id | TEXT | Retained as a plain column for display-compat with pre-0017 admin widgets. On daily pieces this holds the piece_date; on legacy/lesson content, the lesson identifier. No longer part of the PK. |
| course_id | TEXT | e.g. "daily", "body" |
| date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD — activity date (when the reader hit the page), not publish date |
| views | INTEGER | Default 0 |
| completions | INTEGER | Default 0 |
| avg_time_seconds | INTEGER | |
| drop_off_beat | TEXT | Most common drop-off point |
| audio_plays | INTEGER | Default 0 |

PK: **(piece_id, course_id, date)** since migration 0017. Indexes: `idx_engagement_course` on `course_id`, `idx_engagement_date` on `date`, `idx_engagement_piece` on `piece_id`. Migrations: `0003_engagement_learnings.sql` (initial), `0017_engagement_piece_id.sql` (PK rebuild + backfill).

### learnings
Cross-agent learnings database — patterns that work or don't. Drafter reads the 10 most recent rows (across all sources / categories) at runtime and includes them in its prompt — the loop the system uses to improve on itself.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| category | TEXT | `voice` \| `structure` \| `engagement` \| `fact`. What kind of learning it is — shapes which prompt it should inform. |
| observation | TEXT | The insight |
| evidence | TEXT | JSON: what supports this |
| confidence | INTEGER | 0-100 |
| applied_to_prompts | INTEGER | 0 or 1 |
| source | TEXT | `reader` \| `producer` \| `self-reflection` \| `zita`. Where the signal came from. Loose TEXT, nullable — no CHECK constraint because a future fifth origin is cheap to add at the write site. NULL means "unspecified (pre-P1.3)". Indexed via `idx_learnings_source`. **Application layer is stricter than the schema:** `writeLearning` refuses to insert a row whose `source` is null, empty, or non-string — logs a warn to `observer_events` and skips. Column nullability remains so historical pre-P1.3 rows stay readable; new rows must always carry a source. |
| piece_date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD of the `daily_pieces` row this learning is about. Nullable at schema level so migration 0012 could apply non-destructively to pre-existing rows, which were then filled via a one-time manual UPDATE matching `learnings.created_at` to `daily_pieces.published_at`. **Application layer enforces non-null going forward:** `writeLearning` refuses rows missing `piece_date`, same defensive pattern as `source` (both checks route through the shared `logMissingField` helper). Indexed via `idx_learnings_piece_date`. Primary read path: the per-piece "What the system learned" section of the How-this-was-made drawer. |
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID) this learning is about. Added migration 0014 (cadence Phase 1). Nullable at schema level; backfilled for all 27 prod rows via `piece_date → daily_pieces.date → daily_pieces.id` lookup. Indexed via `idx_learnings_piece_id`. `piece_date` stays alongside — Phase 3+ callers pass both; a later phase may drop `piece_date` once the dual-key write posture is proven. |
| created_at | INTEGER | |
| last_validated_at | INTEGER | |

`category` and `source` are orthogonal: `category` is *what* kind of learning (voice/structure/…); `source` is *who* produced the signal (reader/producer/…).

Migrations: `0003_engagement_learnings.sql` (initial), `0011_learnings_source.sql` (added `source`), `0012_learnings_piece_date.sql` (added `piece_date`), `0014_piece_id_fks.sql` (added `piece_id`).

### audit_results
One row per audit pass per draft — durable audit trail. Written by DirectorAgent after each audit round.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| task_id | TEXT | e.g. `daily/2026-04-17` — pipeline run ID |
| draft_id | TEXT | e.g. `daily/2026-04-17-r1` (task + round) |
| auditor | TEXT | voice, structure, or fact |
| passed | INTEGER | 0 or 1 |
| score | INTEGER | 0-100 for voice auditor, null for others |
| notes | TEXT | JSON: violations, issues, or claims |
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID) this audit is about. Added migration 0014 (cadence Phase 1), writer-side threading + full backfill via migrations 0018+0019 (2026-04-22 piece_id schema fix). Director pre-allocates pieceId at run-start and `saveAuditResults(taskId, pieceId, round, …)` writes it on every audit row. Initial backfill (0014) covered 3 prod rows via date-join; 0019 completed the remaining 9 rows (2026-04-22 multi-per-day split by midpoint). Indexed via `idx_audit_results_piece`. Existing `task_id` / `draft_id` stay alongside — they're per-round identifiers that don't cleanly map to a single piece without the FK. See DECISIONS 2026-04-22 "piece_id columns on day-keyed tables". |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Indexes: `idx_audit_task` on `task_id`, `idx_audit_created` on `created_at`, `idx_audit_results_piece` on `piece_id`.

Migrations: `0004_audit_results.sql` (original), `0008_drop_agent_tasks.sql` (dropped the FK to the deleted `agent_tasks` table; original `audit_results` was empty across all runs because every INSERT failed the orphaned FK check), `0014_piece_id_fks.sql` (added `piece_id`).

### magic_tokens
Time-limited tokens for magic link passwordless login.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| token | TEXT PK | 64-char hex, cryptographically random |
| email | TEXT | The email the link was sent to |
| user_id | TEXT | FK→users if user exists, null for new signups |
| expires_at | INTEGER | Unix timestamp ms, 30 minutes from creation |
| used_at | INTEGER | Null until clicked, prevents reuse |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Migration: `0005_magic_tokens.sql`

## Daily Pieces tables

### daily_candidates
News candidates from the Scanner, evaluated by the Director.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD |
| headline | TEXT | News headline |
| source | TEXT | e.g. "Reuters", "BBC" |
| category | TEXT | TOP, TECHNOLOGY, SCIENCE, BUSINESS, HEALTH, WORLD |
| summary | TEXT | Short description from RSS |
| url | TEXT | Link to original story |
| teachability_score | INTEGER | 0-100, set by Director |
| selected | INTEGER | 1 if Director picked this story. **Historical data-flow quirk:** all 250 prod rows have `selected=0` despite 5 pieces having been published — see FOLLOWUPS "`daily_candidates.selected` never flipped on historical runs". |
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID) for the run that produced this candidate batch. Added migration 0014 (cadence Phase 1), semantic extended by migrations 0018+0019 (2026-04-22 piece_id schema fix). Scanner now writes piece_id on **every** candidate row at INSERT time (not just the picked one) — Director pre-allocates pieceId at the top of `triggerDailyPiece` and passes it into `scanner.scan(pieceId)`. All 350 historical rows backfilled via 0019 (pre-2026-04-22 via date-join, 2026-04-22 via midpoint split between the two same-date pieces). Indexed via `idx_candidates_piece_id`. See DECISIONS 2026-04-22 "piece_id columns on day-keyed tables". |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Migrations: `0006_daily_pieces.sql`, `0014_piece_id_fks.sql` (added `piece_id`).

### daily_pieces
Published daily teaching pieces.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD |
| headline | TEXT | The teaching piece title |
| underlying_subject | TEXT | What it teaches about |
| source_story | TEXT | Original news source |
| word_count | INTEGER | |
| beat_count | INTEGER | |
| voice_score | INTEGER | |
| fact_check_passed | INTEGER | |
| has_interactive | INTEGER | **Deprecated as of migration 0022.** Scaffolded in 0006, never read or written by any code path, always 0 in production. `interactive_id` (below) is the single source of truth for "does this piece have an interactive". Column stays physical because SQLite DROP COLUMN would require a `daily_pieces` table rebuild (blast radius too big for hygiene). No writer touches it going forward. |
| reading_minutes | INTEGER | |
| quality_flag | TEXT | NULL = normal, 'low' = audit failed after max revisions |
| has_audio | INTEGER | 0 or 1. Flipped to 1 by `Publisher.publishAudio` when the audio second-commit succeeds. Never set by Producer or Auditor. |
| interactive_id | TEXT | `interactives.id` (UUID) for the 1:1 interactive generated for this piece. NULL = no interactive. Set by InteractiveGeneratorAgent's final publish step (sub-task 4.4). Nullable, non-enforced FK, consistent with codebase convention. Indexed via `idx_daily_pieces_interactive`. Added migration 0022. |
| published_at | INTEGER | |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Migrations: `0006_daily_pieces.sql`, `0009_quality_flag.sql`, `0010_audio_pipeline.sql` (added `has_audio`), `0022_interactives.sql` (added `interactive_id`; deprecated `has_interactive`)

### daily_piece_audio
Per-beat audio rows — one row per `<lesson-beat>` per piece. Producer writes; Auditor reads; Publisher reads for the second-commit frontmatter splice; transparency drawer + admin deep-dive page render from this.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID). Part of composite PK. Added via migration 0015 (cadence Phase 1) — previously `date` held this role. |
| beat_name | TEXT | e.g. "hook", "teach-1", "close". Matches `<lesson-beat name="…">`. Part of composite PK. |
| date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD. Kept as a non-PK column for display/filter after the 0015 PK rebuild — no longer part of the key. |
| r2_key | TEXT | e.g. `audio/daily/2026-04-18/hook.mp3` |
| public_url | TEXT | URL the reader fetches. Currently `/{r2_key}` — needs site-worker R2 binding to resolve in prod. |
| character_count | INTEGER | Characters sent to ElevenLabs (post-`prepareForTTS`) — the billed count. |
| duration_seconds | INTEGER | Nullable — not currently measured. |
| request_id | TEXT | ElevenLabs `request-id` response header. Used for prosodic stitching on the next beat (`previous_request_ids`). |
| model | TEXT | e.g. `eleven_multilingual_v2`. Stored per row so future model swaps are visible in audit history. |
| voice_id | TEXT | e.g. `j9jfwdrw7BRfcR43Qohk` (Frederick Surrey). Same reason as model. |
| generated_at | INTEGER | Unix timestamp ms. |

PK: **(piece_id, beat_name)** (since migration 0015). Indexes: `idx_piece_audio_piece` on `piece_id`, `idx_piece_audio_date` on `date`.

Migrations: `0010_audio_pipeline.sql` (original, PK was (date, beat_name)), `0015_daily_piece_audio_piece_id_pk.sql` (PK rebuild to (piece_id, beat_name), snapshot → create-new → copy → drop-old → rename, with `daily_piece_audio_backup_20260421` held for rollback through 2026-04-28).

### pipeline_log
Step-by-step record of each daily piece run. The admin dashboard polls this for the live pipeline monitor.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| run_id | TEXT | `YYYY-MM-DD` — the calendar day of this step's run. **Semantic walk-back 2026-04-21:** Phase 1's briefing had proposed shifting run_id to piece_id UUIDs, and the backfill ran, but four site-worker queries (`made.ts`, admin piece deep-dive, dashboard pipeline API + index) had embedded `run_id = YYYY-MM-DD` assumptions. Backfill rolled back from `pipeline_log_backup_20260421` the same day. Revised architecture: run_id stays date-shape permanently; `piece_id` is added as an additive column (below). See DECISIONS 2026-04-21 "Roll back `pipeline_log.run_id` backfill". |
| piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` (UUID) — the piece this step belongs to. Added migration 0018, backfilled via 0019 (date-join for pre-2026-04-22; midpoint-split for 2026-04-22 multi-per-day rows). Director pre-allocates `pieceId` at the top of `triggerDailyPiece` and threads through every `logStep()` call so every row carries it going forward. Nullable at schema level (defensive for orphan pre-0018 rows); populated on every new row. Indexed via `idx_pipeline_log_piece`. Admin per-piece deep-dive scopes by this; admin home pipeline history continues to group by `run_id` for day-view semantics. See DECISIONS 2026-04-22 "piece_id columns on day-keyed tables". |
| step | TEXT | scanning, curating, drafting, auditing_r1, publishing, done, error |
| status | TEXT | running, done, failed |
| data | TEXT | JSON with step-specific data (scores, counts, headlines) |
| created_at | INTEGER | |

Migrations: `0007_pipeline_log.sql` (initial). Migration 0014's proposed run_id semantic shift was reverted same-day — no net schema or data change. `0018_pipeline_log_piece_id.sql` added the `piece_id TEXT` column + `idx_pipeline_log_piece` (additive, no PK rebuild). `0019_piece_id_backfill.sql` populated all 153 historical rows.

### admin_settings
Key/value table for admin-configurable system state. One row per setting. First consumer is `interval_hours` read by Director (Phase 2 of the cadence plan); future settings (rate limits, feature flags, voice overrides, scanner feed overrides) live here too.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| key | TEXT PK | e.g. `interval_hours` |
| value | TEXT NOT NULL | Stringly-typed. Caller parses to expected shape via helper (`agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts` → `getAdminSetting<T>(db, key, parse, fallback)`). Non-null even when logically empty — use a sentinel value rather than allowing null. |
| updated_at | INTEGER NOT NULL | Unix timestamp ms. Last write time. |

Read path: [`getAdminSetting`](../agents/src/shared/admin-settings.ts) — swallows every failure mode (missing row, non-string value, DB throw) and returns the caller's `fallback`. Fresh read per call, no caching.

Write path: currently seeded via migration only (`INSERT OR IGNORE interval_hours='24'`). Phase 5 of the cadence plan adds the admin UI + `/api/dashboard/admin/settings` endpoint, with an `admin_settings_changed` observer_event fired alongside every UPDATE for audit-trail.

Seeded values: `interval_hours = '24'` (preserves current 1-piece/day production cadence until Phase 3 wires the hourly gate).

Migration: `0016_admin_settings.sql`

### categories
Taxonomy for browsing the library by subject and for the Categoriser agent's reuse-bias assignments. One row per category. Operator-curated (rename / merge / delete / lock) from `/dashboard/admin/categories/`; populated from day one by the Categoriser agent and the one-time seed script over pre-Categoriser published pieces.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| slug | TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE | kebab-case. Powers the `/library/` category filter URL. Stored on the row (not derived from `name`) so a rename never silently breaks external bookmarks; slug only changes on explicit operator edit or on merge (target wins). |
| name | TEXT NOT NULL | Human display form, e.g. "Chokepoints & Supply" |
| description | TEXT | One-liner of what belongs here. Shown to Categoriser in its system prompt so the reuse-bias has real signal; also shown on the admin page. Nullable. |
| locked | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | 1 = Categoriser MUST NOT reassign away from this category (can still assign TO it). Enforced in agent logic, not schema. |
| piece_count | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | Denormalised counter — library renders chips sorted by count on every request. Maintained by the writer (Categoriser insert + admin merge/delete). Admin page has a "Recount" escape hatch for drift. |
| created_at | INTEGER NOT NULL | Unix ms |
| updated_at | INTEGER NOT NULL | Unix ms, bumped on any mutation |

Indexes: `idx_categories_slug` on `slug` (explicit, alongside the UNIQUE auto-index), `idx_categories_piece_count` on `piece_count DESC`. Migration: `0021_categories.sql`.

### piece_categories
Join table — one row per (piece, category) assignment. Categoriser writes 1–3 rows per piece; admin merge/delete rewrites in bulk inside a transaction.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| piece_id | TEXT NOT NULL | `daily_pieces.id`. Non-enforced FK, consistent with the rest of this codebase's join columns. |
| category_id | TEXT NOT NULL | `categories.id`. Same non-enforced FK convention. |
| confidence | INTEGER NOT NULL | 0–100. Categoriser's confidence in this specific assignment. No CHECK; application layer clamps. |
| created_at | INTEGER NOT NULL | Unix ms |

PK: **composite `(piece_id, category_id)`** — idempotent; Categoriser can safely re-run. Indexes: `idx_piece_categories_piece` on `piece_id` (per-piece lookup), `idx_piece_categories_category` on `category_id` (per-category filter + piece_count recount). Migration: `0021_categories.sql`.

## Interactives tables

### interactives
Standalone teaching artefacts — first-class concept, not a piece sub-feature. First type is `quiz`; extensible to `breathing`, `game`, `chart`, etc. Each has its own URL at `/interactives/<slug>/` and is useful without reading the source piece ("essence not reference"). Generated post-publish by InteractiveGeneratorAgent (15th agent, sub-task 4.4); audited by InteractiveAuditorAgent (16th agent, sub-task 4.5) with up to 3 revision rounds.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| slug | TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE | kebab-case. Powers `/interactives/<slug>/`. Stored, not derived — renames don't break URLs. |
| type | TEXT NOT NULL | `'quiz'` initially; extensible. Loose TEXT, no CHECK — consistent with `learnings.source` / `observer_events.severity`. |
| title | TEXT NOT NULL | Display title. |
| concept | TEXT | The essence — what this teaches. D1 column nullable; the **content-collection schema requires it** (`z.string().min(1)` in `src/content.config.ts`) since 2026-04-25 — every JSON file in `content/interactives/` must have a non-empty concept, which feeds the page subtitle AND meta description. Generator's structural validator throws on empty before file write; auditor flags topic-labels and off-voice phrasing. |
| source_piece_id | TEXT | `daily_pieces.id` the Generator was triggered from. Nullable (standalone-authored interactives in future). Non-enforced FK. |
| content_json | TEXT | Type-specific payload. **Nullable convenience mirror in v1** — sub-task 4.2 chose content-collection (git-versioned `content/interactives/<slug>.json`) as the authoritative source of truth. Writers leave `content_json` NULL; readers always read from the file via `getCollection('interactives')`. Column stays on the row for future admin queries that want to filter/search by content shape without joining to the file system. |
| voice_score | INTEGER | 0–100 from InteractiveAuditor. |
| quality_flag | TEXT | NULL = passed; `'low'` = audit max-failed (3 rounds) but the last attempt was shipped anyway (2026-04-24 reversal of 4.5's abandon-on-max-fail). Mirrors `daily_pieces.quality_flag`. Readers reach the interactive at its URL AND via the last-beat prompt on the source piece — flagged-low interactives surface alongside clean ones (the prior `qualityFlag !== 'low'` filter in sub-task 4.6's lookup map was dropped 2026-04-24; it had been kept as vestigial future-proofing for exactly this reversal). Admin UI marks FLAGGED LOW + shows retry button. See DECISIONS 2026-04-24 "Loosen InteractiveAuditor essence rule + ship-as-low on max-fail". |
| revision_count | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | Auditor rounds used (0–3). |
| published_at | INTEGER | Unix ms. Null while Generator/Auditor loop runs; set on final accept. |
| created_at | INTEGER NOT NULL | Unix ms |

Indexes: `idx_interactives_slug` (explicit, alongside UNIQUE auto-index), `idx_interactives_source_piece` on `source_piece_id`, `idx_interactives_published_at` on `published_at DESC`. Migration: `0022_interactives.sql`.

### interactive_engagement
Append-only event log of reader interactions with interactives. Not aggregated per day like `engagement` — per-question correctness arrays don't aggregate cleanly, and the natural shape is events (offered / started / completed / skipped). Aggregation happens at query time.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT PK | UUID |
| user_id | TEXT NOT NULL | `users.id`. Anonymous-first — middleware always guarantees a user. Non-enforced FK. |
| interactive_id | TEXT NOT NULL | `interactives.id`. Non-enforced FK. |
| event_type | TEXT NOT NULL | `'offered'` \| `'started'` \| `'completed'` \| `'skipped'`. Loose TEXT. |
| score | INTEGER | Correct-count for `completed` rows; null otherwise. |
| per_question_correctness | TEXT | JSON array e.g. `[1,0,1,1,0]` for `completed` rows; null otherwise. |
| created_at | INTEGER NOT NULL | Unix ms |

Indexes: `idx_int_engagement_user` on `user_id`, `idx_int_engagement_interactive` on `interactive_id`, `idx_int_engagement_int_type` on `(interactive_id, event_type)`. Migration: `0022_interactives.sql`.

## Migrations summary (22 migrations, 18 tables)

- `0011_learnings_source.sql` — added `learnings.source` (reader/producer/self-reflection/zita, nullable TEXT, no CHECK) + `idx_learnings_source`. Plumbing for P1.3 — widens the Learner from reader-only to all-signal.
- `0012_learnings_piece_date.sql` — added `learnings.piece_date` (YYYY-MM-DD TEXT, nullable at schema level for backfillability, enforced non-null at the application layer) + `idx_learnings_piece_date`. Enables the per-piece "What the system learned" section of the How-this-was-made drawer. Backfill for pre-migration rows is included as a commented one-time UPDATE inside the migration file (not auto-applied); mapping works via nearest-timestamp join of `learnings.created_at` to `daily_pieces.published_at`, restricted to producer/self-reflection sources.
- `0013_zita_messages_piece_date.sql` — added `zita_messages.piece_date` (YYYY-MM-DD TEXT, nullable at schema level for backfillability, enforced non-null at the application layer for `course_slug='daily'`) + composite `idx_zita_piece(user_id, piece_date)`. Fixes the data-model bug where every daily piece mounted `<zita-chat course="daily" lesson="0">` and pooled all pieces' conversations under one key. Backfill for the 92 pre-migration rows is a commented one-time block inside the migration file, mapped by hand from conversation content + created_at windows against the five pieces 2026-04-17 through 2026-04-21. Includes a snapshot step (`zita_messages_backup_20260421`) run before any UPDATE — rollback is `DELETE + INSERT SELECT` from the backup. Backup table queued for drop on or after 2026-04-28 via FOLLOWUPS.
- `0014_piece_id_fks.sql` — multi-piece cadence Phase 1. Added nullable `piece_id TEXT` FK columns + indexes to `audit_results`, `learnings`, `zita_messages`, `daily_candidates`. Auto-applied ALTERs; backfill UPDATEs commented for manual `wrangler d1 execute` runs (all 4 tables + `pipeline_log.run_id` semantic shift from `YYYY-MM-DD` strings to `daily_pieces.id` UUIDs). Applied 2026-04-21. `daily_candidates` has no historical backfill — 250 rows, 0 with `selected=1` (separate FOLLOWUPS investigation).
- `0015_daily_piece_audio_piece_id_pk.sql` — multi-piece cadence Phase 1, PK rebuild. `daily_piece_audio` PK switched from `(date, beat_name)` to `(piece_id, beat_name)` via snapshot → create-new → copy → drop-old → rename, all auto-applied. 32 rows backfilled via correlated subquery on `daily_pieces.date`. `daily_piece_audio_backup_20260421` snapshot held for rollback through 2026-04-28 via FOLLOWUPS.
- `0016_admin_settings.sql` — multi-piece cadence Phase 2. Created `admin_settings(key, value, updated_at)` — first admin-configurable surface in Zeemish v2. Seeded `interval_hours='24'` via `INSERT OR IGNORE` (preserves current 1-piece/day cadence). Read by Director at start of `triggerDailyPiece`; gate logic lands in Phase 3. Future settings (rate limits, feature flags, voice overrides) will use the same table.
- `0017_engagement_piece_id.sql` — multi-piece cadence Phase 7 (FOLLOWUPS wrap). Rebuilt `engagement` with PK `(piece_id, course_id, date)` via snapshot → create-new → backfill-join → drop-old → rename, all auto-applied. 13 historical rows backfilled from `daily_pieces` via `e.lesson_id = dp.date` join (unambiguous at 1/day — 5 piece_ids, 0 NULLs). `lesson_id` kept as a plain column for display-compat. `engagement_backup_20260422` snapshot held for rollback through 2026-04-29 via FOLLOWUPS. Unblocks reader-path attribution at multi-per-day — `Learner.analyseAndLearn` now reads piece_id directly off the engagement row instead of the pre-Phase-7 partial-fix date-lookup.
- `0018_pipeline_log_piece_id.sql` — multi-per-day piece_id schema fix Phase 1. Added nullable `piece_id TEXT` to `pipeline_log` + `idx_pipeline_log_piece`. Completes the piece_id column coverage across all three day-keyed tables (0014 had `audit_results` + `daily_candidates`; this finishes the set). Additive ALTER, no snapshot needed. See DECISIONS 2026-04-22 "piece_id columns on day-keyed tables".
- `0019_piece_id_backfill.sql` — multi-per-day piece_id schema fix Phase 2. Manual (not auto-applied) — commented UPDATEs run via `wrangler d1 execute`, same pattern as 0012 and 0014 Step 2. Two strategies: pre-2026-04-22 rows via `daily_pieces.date` join (unambiguous at 1/day), 2026-04-22 rows via midpoint split at timestamp `1776850364493` between the two pieces' `published_at`. 512 null rows populated across the three tables (9 `audit_results` + 153 `pipeline_log` + 350 `daily_candidates`). 0 NULL remaining across all three. Verified row-by-row against production D1.
- `0020_observer_events_piece_id.sql` — multi-per-day audit. Added nullable `piece_id TEXT` to `observer_events` + `idx_observer_events_piece`. Additive ALTER, no backfill — historical rows stay NULL and surface on per-piece admin via the existing 36h day-of-publish window fallback. New writes from `agents/src/observer.ts` (13 helpers, piece-scoped signature extended) and `src/lib/observer-events.ts` (optional `pieceId` field) populate piece_id going forward. System-event writers (admin settings changes, Zita rate limits) keep piece_id NULL permanently.
- `0021_categories.sql` — Area 2 sub-task 2.1. Created `categories(id, slug UNIQUE, name, description, locked, piece_count, created_at, updated_at)` + `piece_categories(piece_id, category_id, confidence, created_at)` with composite PK. Data surface for the 14th agent (Categoriser, sub-task 2.2) plus the library category filter (sub-task 2.4) and admin management page (sub-task 2.5). Both tables empty at migration time — populated organically by Categoriser on new pieces and by a one-time seed script (sub-task 2.3) over pre-Categoriser pieces. Additive, rollback = DROP both tables.
- `0022_interactives.sql` — Area 4 sub-task 4.1. Created `interactives(id, slug UNIQUE, type, title, concept, source_piece_id, content_json, voice_score, quality_flag, revision_count, published_at, created_at)` + `interactive_engagement(id, user_id, interactive_id, event_type, score, per_question_correctness, created_at)` append-only event log. Added `daily_pieces.interactive_id TEXT` as the single source of truth for "piece has an interactive" — deprecated the unused `has_interactive` INTEGER column scaffolded in 0006 (left physical since SQLite DROP COLUMN would require a `daily_pieces` rebuild with too-wide blast radius). Data surface for the 15th + 16th agents (InteractiveGenerator + InteractiveAuditor, sub-tasks 4.4 + 4.5). All new tables empty at migration time. Additive, rollback = DROP both new tables (the `daily_pieces.interactive_id` column stays inert when null if code is rolled back).
